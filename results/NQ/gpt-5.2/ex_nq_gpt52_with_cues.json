Managing rigor and then aging (post-rigor) helps improve tenderness.\n- **Guides the timing of deboning and cutting**: Deboning or cutting **too early (pre-rigor)** can cause muscle contraction and shortening, leading to **tougher meat** and distorted cuts. Many plants set minimum \u201ctime-to-debone\u201d standards to avoid this.\n- **Affects water-holding capacity and yield**: pH decline during rigor affects protein structure. Poorly managed rigor can increase **drip loss/purge**, reducing saleable weight and affecting juiciness.\n- **Controls meat color and appearance**: The pH and temperature conditions during rigor influence color development. Improper rigor conditions contribute to quality defects such as **PSE (pale, soft, exudative)** or **DFD (dark, firm, dry)** meat.\n- **Informs chilling strategy**: Chilling too fast before rigor can cause **cold shortening** (especially in beef/lamb), making meat tough. Chilling too warm/slow can raise spoilage risk. Processors balance temperature decline with the progression of rigor.\n- **Supports consistent product quality and processing decisions**: Knowing the rigor state helps decide when to **age**, **inject/brace**, **tumble**, **freeze**, or apply **electrical stimulation** to control rigor development and improve tenderness and yield.\n\nIn short, controlling rigor mortis (through handling, chilling rate, and timing of fabrication) is central to producing meat that is tender, attractive, and high-yield.",

By 7 weeks, this becomes more concerning\u2014especially if your dates are certain.\n\n3. **A pregnancy that is not progressing normally**\n   Sometimes the embryo appears later, but sometimes it never does. That\u2019s why follow-up is important.\n\n### What doctors usually do next\n- **Repeat transvaginal ultrasound in 7\u201314 days** (often 1 week) to look for development of an embryo and heartbeat.\n- **Serial beta-hCG blood tests** (taken 48 hours apart) may help, but ultrasound is usually the key once a gestational sac/yolk sac is seen.\n\n### When it can be diagnosed as nonviable (common criteria)\nClinicians may diagnose pregnancy failure if **either** of these is seen on a high-quality transvaginal ultrasound:\n- **Mean sac diameter (MSD) \u2265 25 mm with no embryo**, or\n- **Embryo crown\u2013rump length (CRL) \u2265 7 mm with no heartbeat**\n(If measurements are below these cutoffs, they typically wait and re-scan.)\n\n### When to seek urgent care now\nGo to urgent care/ER if you have:\n- Heavy bleeding (soaking pads), severe cramping/one-sided pain\n- Shoulder pain, fainting, dizziness (ectopic warning signs)\n- Fever or foul-smelling discharge\n\n### What to ask your OB/clinic\n- What were the **measurements** (MSD, yolk sac size)?  \n- Was the scan **transvaginal**?  \n- When should the **repeat ultrasound** be scheduled?\n\nIf you share the ultrasound measurements (MSD and any mention of fetal pole/CRL) and whether your dates are based on LMP or ovulation/IVF, I can help you understand how concerning this is and what the usual next step would be.",

      "original_extracted": "Becoming a **santero/a** (an initiated priest/priestess in **La Regla de Ocha/Lukum\u00ed**, often called Santer\u00eda) is a **religious initiation process** that varies by lineage, country, and \u201chouse\u201d (il\u00e9). In general, it looks like this:\n\n1) **Learn and build a relationship with a legitimate community**\n- Spend time in an **il\u00e9 (house/temple family)** under a respected elder: an **Olorisha/Santero(a)** and usually a **godparent** (**madrina/padrino**).\n- Attend ceremonies as appropriate, learn etiquette, songs, offerings, and community responsibilities.\n- This tradition is largely **oral** and lived through community practice, not just books.\n\n2) **Receive guidance through divination**\n- A godparent (or an If\u00e1 priest, depending on the house) will often use **dilog\u00fan** (cowrie shells) or other divination methods to determine what you should receive and whether initiation is indicated.\n- Divination also clarifies which **orisha** \u201cclaims your head\u201d (your **tutelary orisha**), though this may be confirmed later through ceremony.\n\n3) **Begin with foundational ceremonies (commonly)**\nMany people receive some or all of the following before full initiation (names and sequence vary by lineage):\n- **Elekes**: receiving consecrated bead necklaces of the orishas.\n- **Warriors (Los Guerreros)**: sacred objects/relationships often associated with Elegu\u00e1, Ogun, Ochosi, and Osun (varies by tradition).\n- **\u201cHand of Orula\u201d (Mano de Orula)**: a ceremony in the If\u00e1 stream that provides guidance and taboos; common in many communities but not universal.\n\n4) **Commit to full initiation (\u201cmaking Ocha\u201d)**\nTo become a santero/a in the strict sense, you undergo **Kari Ocha / Asiento** (often described as \u201ccrowning\u201d):\n- It\u2019s an intensive multi-day initiation led by your godparent(s) and a team of initiated priests.\n- You receive consecrations, rituals, and obligations tied to your tutelary orisha and the house\u2019s lineage.\n\n5) **Complete the iyaworaje (\u201cyear in white\u201d)**\nAfter initiation, you typically observe a period (often **one year**) with specific rules:\n- Wearing white, behavioral restrictions, ritual obligations, and regular check-ins.\n- This period is about protection, discipline, and integrating into priestly life.\n\n6) **Ongoing obligations and growth**\n- Continued learning, service to the community, regular spiritual maintenance, and ceremonies as required.\n- Over time, you may receive additional responsibilities and titles within your lineage.\n\nPractical notes:\n- **It is not a quick or purely self-directed path.** Legit initiation requires a recognized lineage and community.\n- **Costs can be significant** (animals/food, materials, lodging, supporting the house). Be cautious of people who \u201cguarantee\u201d outcomes, rush you, or refuse to explain basic expectations.\n- If you tell me your location and whether you\u2019re looking for **Ocha (santero/a)** or **If\u00e1 (babalawo)**, I can suggest safe ways to vet a house and questions to ask a potential godparent.",
