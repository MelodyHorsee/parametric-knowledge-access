When **sunlight returns in Antarctic spring (Aug\u2013Oct)**, UV-driven chemistry kicks in and ozone is destroyed quickly, producing the seasonal \u201chole.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s not a literal hole, but a **large seasonal drop in ozone concentration** caused by **chlorine/bromine chemistry amplified by Antarctica\u2019s cold, isolated stratosphere**.",
