Managing rigor and then aging (post-rigor) helps improve tenderness.\n- **Guides the timing of deboning and cutting**: Deboning or cutting **too early (pre-rigor)** can cause muscle contraction and shortening, leading to **tougher meat** and distorted cuts. Many plants set minimum \u201ctime-to-debone\u201d standards to avoid this.\n- **Affects water-holding capacity and yield**: pH decline during rigor affects protein structure. Poorly managed rigor can increase **drip loss/purge**, reducing saleable weight and affecting juiciness.\n- **Controls meat color and appearance**: The pH and temperature conditions during rigor influence color development. Improper rigor conditions contribute to quality defects such as **PSE (pale, soft, exudative)** or **DFD (dark, firm, dry)** meat.\n- **Informs chilling strategy**: Chilling too fast before rigor can cause **cold shortening** (especially in beef/lamb), making meat tough. Chilling too warm/slow can raise spoilage risk. Processors balance temperature decline with the progression of rigor.\n- **Supports consistent product quality and processing decisions**: Knowing the rigor state helps decide when to **age**, **inject/brace**, **tumble**, **freeze**, or apply **electrical stimulation** to control rigor development and improve tenderness and yield.\n\nIn short, controlling rigor mortis (through handling, chilling rate, and timing of fabrication) is central to producing meat that is tender, attractive, and high-yield.\n</answer>",
