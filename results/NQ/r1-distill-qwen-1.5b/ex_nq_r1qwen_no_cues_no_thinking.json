The ban was later extended to other forms of punishment in 2017 to address the growing concerns around human rights and the rights of children. The government's stance was to ensure that all forms of punishment are appropriate and effective, but it also emphasized the need to address the systemic issues that led to the suppression of children.

In the late 19th century, inventors like Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Joseph Henry developed the cathode ray tube (CRT) vacuum tube computer, which used a mixture of graphite and hydrogen gas to produce a thin, conductive material. This led to the widespread use of graphite pencils.

However, his direct connection to the United States' independence is not well-documented. The U.S. did not win its independence from the Islamic Caliphate; the independence of the U.S. was achieved through the Civil War of 1863, which was ultimately won by the Federalists under Abraham Lincoln. The U.S. government's independence was established post-World War I by the Congress through the War of 1812. There is no credible evidence linking Al-Qulani to the U.S. independence. The U.S. also did not seek independence from Al-As-Sayyad; the independence of the U.S. was from the U.S. Constitution, which was recognized by the Al-As-Sayyad dynasty through their adoption in 1969.",

Second, stress or tension in the muscles around those areas might contribute to the crackles. Additionally, conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes, or thyroid disorders can affect the thyroid gland, which is responsible for producing the acid that triggers crackles. Over time, these conditions can lead to more severe skin issues, including crackles and other skin problems. It's also possible that the skin is naturally prone to crackles due to its structure. To address this, it's important to consult a healthcare professional who can perform a detailed examination and determine the underlying cause, which may involve treatments like thyroid replacement or lifestyle changes.",

These molecules are produced during the electron transport chain itself, which is part of the process that generates ATP. The NADH and FADH2 are carriers of electrons that are passed along the chain, and the electrons are reduced at the oxygenase position, transferring the electrons to the ATP synthase. This process ensures the generation of ATP as a secondary metabolic product.",

The policy was later revised in 2013 to allow up to two children per family. The policy was officially ended in 2016 when the government started regulating the birth of children in the city of Wuhan, with the goal of promoting a balanced population and reducing the negative impact of having more children.

      "question": "i want to be with you everywhere song",
      "original_extracted": "Alright, so I want to be with you everywhere. Hmm, where do I start? First off, the idea of being with someone in every situation is pretty broad. I guess it could be about companionship, connection, or maybe something more abstract like mutual love or understanding. But how do I make that into a song?\n\nMaybe I should break it down into different sections. The first verse could introduce the main theme, something like wanting to be there for everyone. The chorus might be catchy and reinforce that feeling. Then, there could be a bridge where the emotions get deeper, showing how the connection grows. Finally, the bridge could lead into a bridge section where the song ends, but the emotions are still strong.\n\nI also need to think about the structure. How many verses and choruses? Maybe three verses and two choruses. Each verse can delve deeper into the theme. The chorus should be memorable, so it needs to be catchy and impactful. The bridge should be the climax, showing the strength of the connection.\n\nI should also consider the lyrics. They need to be heartfelt and convey the emotions clearly. Maybe start with something simple and then build up. The language should be warm and inviting, making the listener feel connected.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to incorporate some of the feeling of being with someone in every situation into the lyrics. Maybe use metaphors like being in every moment, or being there for every person. That could make the song more personal and genuine.\n\nAlso, the outro should leave a lasting impression. It should encourage the listener to feel the connection and maybe even to be with someone in every situation themselves. A strong closing line that leaves the listener feeling inspired.\n\nOverall, the song should be a heartfelt exploration of wanting to be with someone everywhere, with lyrics that capture the emotions and a structure that guides the listener through the journey of connection.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nAlright, let's dive into a song about wanting to be with someone everywhere. Here's the structure and lyrics:\n\n**Verse 1:**  \nI want to be with you everywhere,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t deny.  \nFrom the moment you walk by,  \nTo every moment you spend.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n\n**Chorus:**  \nI want to be with you everywhere,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t deny.  \nFrom the moment you walk by,  \nTo every moment you spend.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n(Repeat chorus)  \n\n**Verse 2:**  \nI want to feel like I\u2019m right there,  \nA world that\u2019s mine to belong.  \nFrom the first light you shine,  \nTo the last night you rest.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n\n**Chorus:**  \nI want to be with you everywhere,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t deny.  \nFrom the moment you walk by,  \nTo every moment you spend.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n(Repeat chorus)  \n\n**Bridge:**  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \nFrom the moment you walk by,  \nTo every moment you spend.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n(Repeat bridge)  \n\n**Chorus:**  \nI want to be with you everywhere,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t deny.  \nFrom the moment you walk by,  \nTo every moment you spend.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n(Repeat chorus)  \n\n**Outro:**  \nSo here\u2019s to you, my friend,  \nWho\u2019s always in my arms.  \nFrom the first light you shine,  \nTo the last night you rest.  \nI want to be in your arms,  \nA feeling that I can\u2019t hide.  \n(Repeat outro)",

This process involves the division of a single cell into two identical daughter cells, which can be either identical or non-identical depending on the species. Binary fission is commonly observed in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and plants, although it is less prevalent in some multicellular organisms. The key feature of binary fission is its ability to divide without the need for a membrane, which allows for efficient distribution of genetic material. For example, in many fungi like Mycobacterium, binary fission is a primary mode of cell division. Similarly, in some multicellular organisms like certain types of corals, binary fission is a common mode of cell division. In contrast, mitosis is the more widespread form of cell division in eukaryotic cells, including those with nucleus, and it involves the division of the nucleus and the cytoplasm, resulting in the division of the entire cell into two identical daughter cells.",

In fission, this neutron then splits the nucleus into two smaller ones, releasing energy and neutrons that are distributed among the two products. Additionally, in some cases, neutrons can be generated through beta decay or other nuclear reactions, and in some advanced scenarios, they can be produced directly from nuclear reactions.

The Chola dynasty was known for its vast empire, which included modern-day India, and its wealth came from gold coins issued by its rulers. The Chola kings, including King Chachu Choddi, issued gold coins in denominations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 rupee, which were used as currency in India. These gold coins were a significant part of the Chola currency system and played a crucial role in the economic and social development of India.

The Chola dynasty's gold coins were an important feature of Indian currency and helped to sustain its economy. The Chola kings were also known for their interest in the arts and sciences, and they issued coins that were decorated with carvings of natural scenes, which were believed to hold spiritual significance.",

First, I should understand the context. Dr. Avery is a well-known neuroscientist and a key character on Grey's Anatomy, known for her research on the brain and how it works. \n\nThe user is asking for my final answer in <answer> tags. I need to provide a response that fits this format. Since the user is acting as a character, my response should be engaging and accurate. I should probably start by confirming that I'm the actor, then introduce myself, and provide some background about Dr. Avery to give the user context.\n\nI should make sure the response is concise but informative. Maybe I can add a line about Dr. Avery's role in the show to make it more engaging. I also need to ensure that the final answer is correctly formatted with the <answer> tags at the end.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'll start with a greeting, introduce myself as the actor, mention that I'm playing Dr. Avery, provide a bit about her background, and end with a friendly sign-off. That should cover all the necessary points and fit the required format.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Oh, I'm the actor! I play Dr. Avery on Grey's Anatomy.

The replication process involves several key steps, including the unwinding of the double helix by the helicase, the pairing of the complementary strands, the addition of new nucleotides by the polymerases, and the proofreading to eliminate errors. This process is essential for maintaining genetic information in living organisms and is a fundamental aspect of biological evolution.",

This is because the valve becomes progressively more distended, and at its most distended state, it transitions into a state of full closure. The valve then begins to release blood, allowing the ventricles to contract further during the ejection phase. This closure is crucial for the proper function of the heart, as it ensures that the blood flow is optimal, preventing excessive strain on the valve and the surrounding tissues. During this phase, the valve may also experience some mechanical stress, which can be assessed through imaging techniques like ECG or Doppler. The exact timing of closure can vary among individual heart conditions, but it typically occurs around the end of diastension and the beginning of ejection phase.",

The Dust Bowl was a result of over 1,000 years of long-term drought conditions. The impact of the Dust Bowl was significant, affecting not only the U.S. but also other countries around the world. The Dust Bowl ended in the early 1940s when the U.S. government implemented drought resistance measures and efforts to restore the forest. By 1940, the U.S. had reduced the number of affected states by more than half, and the forest cover had returned to a level that had been restored before the Drought.
