Here's how it works:  \n\n1. **Surface Tension**:  \n   Kerosene has a low viscosity and high surface tension. When you dip the wick into the oil, the liquid molecules at the surface of the oil form a \"skin\" that holds them together. This surface tension causes the oil to climb the wick like a water snake, even though gravity would pull it downward.  \n\n2. **Wick Structure**:  \n   The wick is typically made of natural fibers (like cotton or flax) or synthetic materials. These fibers are absorbent and draw the kerosene upward as the wick dries. The fibers act like a straw, pulling the liquid upward due to capillary action (a type of adhesion where liquids move through narrow spaces).  \n\n3. **Evaporation Cooling**:  \n   As the kerosene evaporates (turns from liquid to gas), it absorbs heat from the surrounding air and the wick. This cooling process further reduces the vapor pressure of the liquid, causing it to rise the wick to replace the evaporated fuel.  \n\nIn short: Surface tension and capillary action overcome gravity, allowing kerosene to rise and fuel the flame.  \n</answer>",

For example:\n- In Season 1, Episode 5 (\"Safe House\"), \"G\" might reference a tech protocol or a codename for a mission.\n- In other episodes, it could be a shorthand for a location, a device, or a classification level within the show's lore.\n\nThe show's creators intentionally avoid real-world acronyms to maintain narrative flexibility. If you encountered \"G\" in a specific episode or fan theory, it likely stems from the show's internal logic rather than official documentation.",

      ],
      "raw_prediction": "6</answer>\n\n**Explanation:**  \nA plane mechanism (also known as a planar mechanism) operates within a single plane. The degrees of freedom (DOF) for a mechanism are determined by the number of independent motions it can perform. For a typical planar mechanism with one output link (e.g., a four-bar linkage or crankshaft), the DOF is calculated as:  \n\n- **Input links (e.g., crank):** 1 DOF (rotation)  \n- **Output links (e.g., connecting rod):** 1 DOF (rotation)  \n- **Other links (e.g., ground links):** 0 DOF (fixed)  \n\nThus, the total DOF for a simple planar mechanism with one input and one output link is **1 (input) + 1 (output) = 2**, but this is not universally correct. For complex mechanisms, the formula is:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{DOF} = \\text{Number of links} - \\text{Number of constraints} + \\text{Number of input DOF}\n\\]  \n\nIn standard planar mechanisms (e.g., four-bar linkage):  \n- 4 links  \n- 4 constraints (e.g., ground links)  \n- 1 input DOF (crank)  \n\\[\n\\text{DOF} = 4 - 4 + 1 = 1 \\ (\\text{output only})\n\\]  \n\nHowever, if considering generalized planar motion (e.g., a robot arm with revolute joints), the DOF depends on the number of joints:  \n- Each revolute joint contributes **1 DOF**.  \n- A typical planar robot arm with \\( n \\) revolute joints has **\\( n \\) DOF**.  \n\nFor common plane mechanisms like crank-and-piston (2 DOF), slider-crank (1 DOF), or four-bar (1 DOF), the answer varies. The question likely assumes a **simple crank-and-piston mechanism** (commonly taught):  \n- Crank (input): 1 rotational DOF  \n- Piston (output): 1 translational DOF  \n\\[\n\\text{Total DOF} = 1 + 1 = 6 \\ (\\text{degrees of freedom})\n\\]  \n\nThis accounts for both translational and rotational motions in the plane. Hence, **6** is the standard answer for \"plane mechanism\" in basic mechanical engineering contexts.",

When plates carrying continents collide, slide past each other, or separate, it creates gaps that allow continents to gradually drift apart over millions of years.

These plates, which make up Earth's lithosphere, can shift due to forces in the mantle (like mantle convection currents). When plates carrying continents collide, slide past each other, or separate, it creates gaps that allow continents to gradually drift apart over millions of years. This process is driven by forces such as seafloor spreading (at mid-ocean ridges) and subduction (where one plate dives beneath another).

This connection suggests the occupation of a measurekeeper or someone involved in trade measurement, such as a taylor (a medieval trade term for a fabric measureman).\n\n2. **Scotland**: In Scottish history, \"Taylor\" was sometimes linked to the town of Tain (in modern-day Ross-shire), though this is less directly tied to the surname's etymology.\n\n3. **Ireland**: The name appears in Irish records, often anglicized from Gaelic forms like *O'Tuama* or *\u00d3 Tuama*, meaning \"descendant of Tuama,\" though this is unrelated to the English/Scottish \"Taylor\" lineage.\n\n4. **Other Regions**: The surname spread globally through immigration, with variations like *Taylor*, *Tayloar*, or *Tayler* appearing in America, Canada, Australia, and beyond.\n\nIn summary, the most widely accepted origin traces the name to medieval England, evolving from occupational terms related to measurement or craftsmanship.</answer>",

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Adiabatic Cooling**:  \n   As the air rises, it expands due to lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. This expansion causes the air to cool adiabatically (without heat exchange with the environment). The temperature drops rapidly\u2014often by 6\u201310\u00b0C per 1,000 meters.\n\n2. **Increased Humidity**:  \n   The cooler, denser air holds less moisture, causing the air mass to become drier and more stable. If the cooling is sufficient, it may reach the dew point, leading to condensation and cloud formation.\n\n3. **Percival Effect**:  \n   The cooling air mass is less dense than the surrounding air at lower altitudes. It spreads outward horizontally, creating a \"warm front\" on the windward side of the mountain and a \"cold front\" on the leeward side. This can cause:\n   - **Windward Side (Upwind)**: Strong winds, heavy precipitation (rain, snow), and stormy weather due to the collision of moist air with the mountain.\n   - **Leeward Side (Downwind)**: Calmer, drier conditions with clear skies and reduced rainfall. This is called the \"rain shadow effect.\"\n\n4. **Elevation Effects**:  \n   The highest peaks experience the most intense cooling, potentially leading to frost, fog, or even snow at higher elevations, even in warmer climates.\n\n5. **Long-Term Impact**:  \n   This process contributes to orographic (mountain-induced) precipitation patterns, shaping local climates and ecosystems. For example, the Andes Mountains create rain shadows in the Amazon Basin, affecting biodiversity.\n\nIn summary, an air mass pushed over a mountain cools rapidly, creates distinct wind and precipitation patterns on either side of the range, and can alter local climate conditions significantly.</answer>",

While **Belichick** and **Walsh** are tied at 6 wins, **Belichick** has the most overall appearances (11) and is widely recognized for his coaching legacy. However, if strictly counting wins, both are tied.  \n\n   **Final Answer:**  \n   - **Coach with the most Super Bowl wins:** **Bill Belichick** (6 wins).  \n   - **Note:** If interpreting \"rings\" as appearances (not wins), **Tom Landry** has the most (5 appearances, all losses). But the standard metric is wins.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Based on Super Bowl wins (the common standard), **Bill Belichick** holds the record. However, if the question implies \"total rings\" (wins + MVP awards), **Patrick Mahomes** (QB) has the most NFL MVP awards (4) and 1 Super Bowl win as a player, but this is not a coaching record.  \n\n**Answer:**  \n<answer>Bill Belichick</answer>  \n\n*(Assuming the question refers to Super Bowl wins by coaches.

The vapor pressure of water at this temperature is calculated using the Antoine equation or standard tables. For water at 100\u00b0C:  \n- Vapor pressure \u2248 1.25 kPa (from tables).  \n- Convert to torr: 1 kPa \u2248 7.50062 torr \u2192 1.25 kPa \u00d7 7.50062 \u2248 9.38 torr.  \n\nHowever, a common approximation for this specific value (100\u00b0C) is **1.25 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 torr** (0.00125 torr), which is incorrect. The correct value is approximately **9.38 torr** (or 9.4 torr when rounded).  \n\n**Correction:**  \nThe provided answer (1.25 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 torr) appears to be a miscalculation. The accurate vapor pressure of water at 100\u00b0C is:  \n**\u2248 9.38 torr** (or 9.4 torr).  \n\nIf the question intended a different context (e.g., low-pressure conditions), additional details would be needed. Otherwise, the standard value at 100\u00b0C is ~9.4 torr.  \n\n**Final Answer (corrected):**  \n<answer>9.4 torr</answer>",

These involved hidden gifts for children, possibly symbolizing rebirth or divine blessings.\n\n2. **Christian Adaptation**: As Christianity spread, some traditions merged with Easter customs. The idea of a \"resurrection\" figure or a hidden \"soul\" (like a golden egg) in Easter baskets may have evolved from these syncretic practices.\n\n3. **17th-Century Popularization**: The modern Easter Bunny became widely recognized in Germany in the 1600s\u20131700s. Children would search for a rabbit or eggs on Easter morning, with stories of the bunny laying eggs and hiding treats. This spread to other cultures through immigration and cultural exchange.\n\n4. **Cultural Variations**: Similar figures exist globally, such as the French \"Papillon d'Avril\" (April Bunny) or the Slavic \"Borovitsa\" (a rabbit-like creature).

      "raw_prediction": "Leaders of the two parties in Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate) are typically chosen through a combination of internal party elections and informal processes, depending on the specific role and party structure. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **House of Representatives (U.S.):**\n   - **Speaker of the House:** The Speaker is the second-highest-ranking official and is elected by the full House at the start of each Congress (after elections). The party with a majority in the House selects its nominee, who then wins a secret ballot vote from all members. The Speaker sets the legislative agenda and presides over House sessions.\n   - **Other Leadership Roles:** Party leaders (e.g., Majority Leader, Minority Leader) are appointed or elected by their party's House members. The Majority Leader coordinates the party's strategy on bills, while the Minority Leader opposes the majority's agenda and advocates for minority interests. These roles are often filled by experienced members with strong political influence.\n\n2. **Senate (U.S.):**\n   - **Party Leaders:** The majority party leader (e.g., Majority Leader) and minority leader (e.g., Minority Leader) are elected by their respective parties' senators at the start of each Congress. The majority leader works to advance party priorities, while the minority leader focuses on blocking them and representing minority viewpoints.\n   - **Vice President:** As President of the Senate, the Vice President has significant influence but is not an elected party leader. The Vice President often aligns with the majority party but is constitutionally separate from party leadership roles.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- **Party Control:** Leaders are chosen based on which party holds the majority in the chamber. If no party has a majority (e.g., in the Senate during a 50-50 split), dynamics become more fluid.\n- **Internal Elections:** Most roles involve internal party elections or appointments by party committees.\n- **Experience and Influence:** Candidates for leadership typically have long histories in politics, strong grassroots support, and proven track records in policy or fundraising.\n\n**Example Process for the House:**\n1. A party selects a candidate for Speaker.\n2. The candidate is nominated to the full House.\n3. All House members vote in secret on the motion to elect the candidate.\n4. The candidate with a majority of \"yea\" votes becomes Speaker.\n\nIn summary, party leaders in Congress are chosen through a mix of elections, appointments, and informal power dynamics, reflecting each party's internal strategy and the broader political landscape.</answer>",

It likely killed 50\u201380% of Athens' population, including healthy adults, children, and even some animals, disrupting ecosystems and food supplies.  \n\n2. **Social and Political Instability**:  \n   Athens' democracy was already fragile. The plague exposed deep societal divisions, weakened public trust in leaders, and fueled resentment toward wealthy elites who avoided disease by fleeing to healthier areas. This eroded civic cohesion and made governance chaotic.  \n\n3. **Economic Collapse**:  \n   Labor shortages (as workers died) caused prices to skyrocket, while those who survived struggled to afford food or pay taxes. The economy collapsed, exacerbating poverty and inequality.  \n\n4. **Religious and Superstitious Fear**:  \n   The plague was interpreted as a divine punishment for Athens' hubris (e.g., over-reliance on science, neglect of traditional rituals). This fear led to purges of \"impure\" individuals, further fragmenting society.  \n\n5. **Long-Term Demographic Impact**:  \n   The population decline left a power vacuum, weakening Athens' military and cultural influence. This contributed to the later fall of the city-state to Sparta in 404 BCE.  \n\nIn essence, the plague acted as a catalyst, exposing and destroying the structural weaknesses of Athenian society, governance, and economy.  \n</answer>",

His previous work (*Sudhane Su Jhane*, 2016) also drew praise for its artistry.\n\n2. **Rajkumar Hirani**  \n   - Directed critically acclaimed films like *Mudbound* (2017), a historical drama based on the Great Migration, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. His storytelling and social themes often earn him respect.\n\n3. **Amitabh Bachchan**  \n   - While primarily an actor, Bachchan directed *piku* (2015) and *pikuperfect* (2019), but in 2017, his work as a director was less prominent compared to his acting career.\n\n4. **Anurag Kashyap**  \n   - Known for gritty, realistic films like *Blackboard* (2018) and *Mukkabaaz* (2016), which gained critical acclaim. His style contrasts with mainstream Bollywood.\n\n5. **Farhan Akhtar**  \n   - Co-directed *Dil Bechara* (2020) and *Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara* (2011), but in 2017, his focus was more on acting in films like *Badrinath Ki Dulhania*.\n\n**Notable 2017 Films**:  \n- *Padmaavat* (released 2018) was in production during 2017 under Bhansali.  \n- *Mudbound* (Hirani) was a standout film that year.  \n- *Kedarnath* (2018) was also in development around this time.  \n\n**Why No Single Answer?**  \n- **Cultural Context**: 2017 saw a mix of commercial hits and critically acclaimed art films.  \n- **Subjectivity**: Some may favor Bhansali for his visual flair, while others prioritize Hirani\u2019s storytelling or Kashyap\u2019s bold narratives.  \n- **Box Office**: Films like *Padmaavat* (post-2017 release) dominated box office, but critical reception varied.  \n\nFor 2017 specifically, **Rajkumar Hirani** stands out for his socially relevant work (*Mudbound*) and critical acclaim, but it\u2019s ultimately a matter of preference.  \n\n<answer>  \nThere is no definitive \"best\" director in Bollywood for 2017, as it depends on criteria like critical acclaim, storytelling, or cultural impact. Notable directors in 2017 included Sanjay Leela Bhansali (known for grand films like *Padmaavat*, in development), Rajkumar Hirani (praised for *Mudbound*), and Anurag Kashyap (for gritty narratives).

His style contrasts with mainstream Bollywood.\n\n5. **Farhan Akhtar**  \n   - Co-directed *Dil Bechara* (2020) and *Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara* (2011), but in 2017, his focus was more on acting in films like *Badrinath Ki Dulhania*.\n\n**Notable 2017 Films**:  \n- *Padmaavat* (released 2018) was in production during 2017 under Bhansali.  \n- *Mudbound* (Hirani) was a standout film that year.  \n- *Kedarnath* (2018) was also in development around this time.  \n\n**Why No Single Answer?**  \n- **Cultural Context**: 2017 saw a mix of commercial hits and critically acclaimed art films.  \n- **Subjectivity**: Some may favor Bhansali for his visual flair, while others prioritize Hirani\u2019s storytelling or Kashyap\u2019s bold narratives.  \n- **Box Office**: Films like *Padmaavat* (post-2017 release) dominated box office, but critical reception varied.  \n\nFor 2017 specifically, **Rajkumar Hirani** stands out for his socially relevant work (*Mudbound*) and critical acclaim, but it\u2019s ultimately a matter of preference.  \n\n<answer>  \nThere is no definitive \"best\" director in Bollywood for 2017, as it depends on criteria like critical acclaim, storytelling, or cultural impact. Notable directors in 2017 included Sanjay Leela Bhansali (known for grand films like *Padmaavat*, in development), Rajkumar Hirani (praised for *Mudbound*), and Anurag Kashyap (for gritty narratives). Rajkumar Hirani's *Mudbound* won critical acclaim, but preferences vary widely.",

They face challenges with each alien form, including a chaotic encounter with a random selection of aliens like Heatblast, Four Arms, and Wildmutt.\n- **Part 2**: The Omnitrix eventually resets, but the experience leaves Ben more confident and the team more prepared for the upcoming season's threats.\n\nThe episode highlights the dynamic between the Tennyson family and introduces themes of adaptability and teamwork. It is not part of a traditional season but a standalone story that sets up Season 3's overarching plot involving the return of Vilgax and the Vilgaxian Empire.",

If Queen Elizabeth II had passed away during King Charles III's reign, Prince William would have succeeded her as the heir apparent. However, since the Queen's death in September 2022, King Charles III has already ascended the throne, and Prince William remains the next in line to become king should the monarch die or abdicate without an heir (which is unlikely, as Prince William has no children and his brother Prince Harry has no heirs of their own).
