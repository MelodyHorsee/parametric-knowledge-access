Here's how it works:  \n\n1. **Surface Tension**:  \n   Kerosene has a low viscosity and high surface tension. When you dip the wick into the oil, the liquid molecules at the surface of the oil form a \"skin\" that holds them together. This surface tension causes the oil to climb the wick like a water snake, even though gravity would pull it downward.  \n\n2. **Wick Structure**:  \n   The wick is typically made of natural fibers (like cotton or flax) or synthetic materials. These fibers are absorbent and draw the kerosene upward as the wick dries. The fibers act like a straw, pulling the liquid upward due to capillary action (a type of adhesion where liquids move through narrow spaces).  \n\n3. **Evaporation Cooling**:  \n   As the kerosene evaporates (turns from liquid to gas), it absorbs heat from the surrounding air and the wick. This cooling process further reduces the vapor pressure of the liquid, causing it to rise the wick to replace the evaporated fuel.  \n\nIn short: Surface tension and capillary action overcome gravity, allowing kerosene to rise and fuel the flame.",

This occurs when oxygen (O\u2082) is partially reduced to H\u2082O\u2082 before being further metabolized into water and energy (ATP).\n\n2. **Xanthine Oxidase Pathway**:  \n   In the liver, xanthine oxidase enzymes break down purines (e.g., from broken-down DNA/RNA) into uric acid. This reaction also produces H\u2082O\u2082 as a secondary metabolite.\n\n3. **Indirect Production via Immune System**:  \n   Phagocytic cells (like neutrophils) use H\u2082O\u2082 to kill pathogens during the respiratory burst. While the body synthesizes H\u2082O\u2082, it can also derive it temporarily from external sources (e.g., applying hydrogen peroxide solutions to wounds), which the body then metabolizes.\n\nThese sources ensure H\u2082O\u2082 plays roles in:  \n- Antimicrobial defense  \n- Detoxification (e.g., in the liver)  \n- Signal transduction in cells",

However, earlier liturgical texts (like the 4th-century \"Epistle to the Romans\") occasionally used \"missa\" alongside other terms. The practice of using \"missa\" persisted for centuries in liturgical traditions, including in medieval and modern Catholic and Orthodox services. The shift to exclusively using \"missa\" became more formalized over time, but it was never a sudden change.

Here's a rough approach using available data:\n\n1. **Surface Area**: The Gulf covers approximately **1.5 million square miles** (3.8 million km\u00b2), comparable to the size of Texas or Mexico itself.\n2. **Average Depth**: The average depth is about **1,500 feet (457 meters)**, but this varies significantly:\n   - Shallow areas (e.g., near the coast) are shallower (e.g., 30\u2013100 feet).\n   - Deeper basins exist (e.g., the Florida Trench reaches ~27,000 feet).\n3. **Volume Calculation**:\n   - Using an average depth of 1,500 feet (0.457 km), the volume is roughly:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume} \\approx \\text{Surface Area} \\times \\text{Average Depth} = 3.8 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{km}^2 \\times 0.457 \\, \\text{km} = 1.74 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{km}^3\n     \\]\n   - Convert to cubic meters: \\(1 \\, \\text{km}^3 = 10^9 \\, \\text{m}^3\\), so \\(1.74 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{km}^3 = 1.74 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{m}^3\\).\n   - Water density is \\(1,000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\), so mass \u2248 \\(1.74 \\times 10^{18} \\, \\text{kg}\\).\n4. **Gallons Equivalent**:\n   - 1 cubic meter of water \u2248 **264 US gallons**.\n   - Total volume in gallons \u2248 \\(1.74 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times 264 \\, \\text{gallons/m}^3 \u2248 4.58 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{gallons}\\).\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- This is a **rough estimate**\u2014actual volume depends on precise bathymetric data and tidal fluctuations.\n- The Gulf is part of the Atlantic Ocean basin, connected to the Gulf of Mexico proper via the Straits of Florida.\n- For context: The entire ocean holds ~1.35 billion cubic kilometers (\u22483.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2078 gallons). The Gulf is a small fraction of that.\n\n**Final Answer**: Approximately **458 quadrillion gallons** (4.58 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2077 gallons), but this is an order-of-magnitude estimate. For precise applications (e.g., environmental studies), satellite altimetry or oceanographic surveys would be used.",

      "original_extracted": "Roar by Katy Perry is a song about female empowerment and self-assertion. The lyrics encourage the listener to stand up for themselves, embrace confidence, and reject being held back or disrespected. Key themes include:  \n- **Strength and confidence** (\"I'm a beast, I'm a beast, I'm a beast!\"),  \n- **Resisting oppression** (\"I won't let you dim my light\"),  \n- **Self-ownership** (\"You can't control me, I'm my own master\"),  \n- **Triumphant resilience** (\"I will roar, I will roar\").  \n\nThe song uses vivid, aggressive imagery (e.g., \"claws out,\" \"roar\") to symbolize breaking free from limitations and claiming power. Katy Perry\u2019s delivery amplifies these themes, making it an anthem for women asserting their independence.",

For example:\n- In Season 1, Episode 5 (\"Safe House\"), \"G\" might reference a tech protocol or a codename for a mission.\n- In other episodes, it could be a shorthand for a location, a device, or a classification level within the show's lore.\n\nThe show's creators intentionally avoid real-world acronyms to maintain narrative flexibility.

The focus was more on abstract crosses or the empty cross (Crucifixus).\n\n2. **Byzantine Era (4th-6th centuries):** The first surviving Christian crucifixes appear in Byzantine art (e.g., the \"Crucifixion of St. Peter\" in the Vatican). This period solidified the cross as sacred, but crucifix imagery remained niche.\n\n3. **Renaissance (14th-16th centuries):** The crucifix gained widespread popularity due to artists like Giotto and later Michelangelo (e.g., the Piet\u00e0). It became central to Catholic devotion, especially in liturgy and private prayer.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** While crosses were always sacred, the *crucifix* as a widespread, iconic symbol emerged most prominently in the late medieval/early Renaissance period.

This era saw advancements in transportation (railroads, steamships) and manufacturing.\n\n4. **Scientific Progress**: Pioneers like Marie Curie (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1903) and Einstein (theoretical physics) were making groundbreaking contributions, though Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity emerged later (early 20th century).\n\n5. **Social Movements**: In the U.S., the Progressive Movement gained traction, advocating for reforms in labor rights, suffrage, and anti-corruption. In Russia, Tsarist rule was weakening amid political unrest.\n\n6. **Global Health**: The bubonic plague periodically resurged in Asia and Africa, though not on the scale of the 14th-century Black Death.\n\n7. **Technology**: The telegraph and telephone were in use, improving global communication. The first transatlantic radio signal was sent in 1901 (by Guglielmo Marconi).\n\nThese developments set the stage for the early 20th century\u2019s geopolitical shifts and cultural transformations.",

This connection suggests the occupation of a measurekeeper or someone involved in trade measurement, such as a taylor (a medieval trade term for a fabric measureman).\n\n2. **Scotland**: In Scottish history, \"Taylor\" was sometimes linked to the town of Tain (in modern-day Ross-shire), though this is less directly tied to the surname's etymology.\n\n3. **Ireland**: The name appears in Irish records, often anglicized from Gaelic forms like *O'Tuama* or *\u00d3 Tuama*, meaning \"descendant of Tuama,\" though this is unrelated to the English/Scottish \"Taylor\" lineage.\n\n4. **Other Regions**: The surname spread globally through immigration, with variations like *Taylor*, *Tayloar*, or *Tayler* appearing in America, Canada, Australia, and beyond.\n\nIn summary, the most widely accepted origin traces the name to medieval England, evolving from occupational terms related to measurement or craftsmanship.",

      "original_extracted": "When an air mass is pushed up and over a mountain range, it undergoes adiabatic cooling and compression, leading to significant changes in weather and atmospheric conditions. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Adiabatic Cooling**:  \n   As the air rises, it expands due to lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. This expansion causes the air to cool adiabatically (without heat exchange with the environment). The temperature drops rapidly\u2014often by 6\u201310\u00b0C per 1,000 meters.\n\n2. **Increased Humidity**:  \n   The cooler, denser air holds less moisture, causing the air mass to become drier and more stable. If the cooling is sufficient, it may reach the dew point, leading to condensation and cloud formation.\n\n3. **Percival Effect**:  \n   The cooling air mass is less dense than the surrounding air at lower altitudes. It spreads outward horizontally, creating a \"warm front\" on the windward side of the mountain and a \"cold front\" on the leeward side. This can cause:\n   - **Windward Side (Upwind)**: Strong winds, heavy precipitation (rain, snow), and stormy weather due to the collision of moist air with the mountain.\n   - **Leeward Side (Downwind)**: Calmer, drier conditions with clear skies and reduced rainfall. This is called the \"rain shadow effect.\"\n\n4. **Elevation Effects**:  \n   The highest peaks experience the most intense cooling, potentially leading to frost, fog, or even snow at higher elevations, even in warmer climates.\n\n5. **Long-Term Impact**:  \n   This process contributes to orographic (mountain-induced) precipitation patterns, shaping local climates and ecosystems. For example, the Andes Mountains create rain shadows in the Amazon Basin, affecting biodiversity.\n\nIn summary, an air mass pushed over a mountain cools rapidly, creates distinct wind and precipitation patterns on either side of the range, and can alter local climate conditions significantly.",

      "original_extracted": "Water that infiltrates the soil and isn't absorbed by plant roots may undergo several processes depending on soil type, moisture conditions, and environmental factors. Here's a breakdown of common outcomes:\n\n1. **Evaporation**:  \n   In dry or exposed soil, water evaporates into the air through the soil surface, contributing to soil moisture loss and atmospheric humidity.\n\n2. **Runoff**:  \n   If the soil surface is saturated or impermeable (e.g., compacted clay), water may flow over the surface as runoff into nearby streams, lakes, or oceans.\n\n3. **Drainage**:  \n   In permeable soils with high drainage capacity, water moves downward through the soil profile until it reaches deeper aquifers or exits the soil entirely.\n\n4. **Transpiration**:  \n   While plants absorb water for transpiration (which *does* occur if infiltrated water is absorbed), unabsorbed water doesn\u2019t contribute to this process.\n\n5. **Soil Moisture Storage**:  \n   In well-drained soils, unabsorbed water may temporarily pool in soil pores before eventually evaporating or percolating deeper.\n\n6. **Subsurface Recirculation**:  \n   In some cases, water may cycle through the soil profile multiple times before leaving the root zone entirely.\n\nThe specific path depends on factors like soil texture (sand, silt, clay), topography, vegetation cover, and climate. For example:  \n- In sandy soils, water drains quickly and is likely lost to evaporation or runoff.  \n- In clay soils, water may percolate slowly or form temporary pools.",

R\u00f6ntgen's 1897 discovery of X-rays provided experimental evidence for the existence of subatomic structures within atoms.

His coronation solidified the establishment of the Kangla dynasty as the sovereign power in Manipur.

After World War I, Germany faced severe economic instability, leading to the Weimar Republic's government printing excessive money, which caused prices to skyrocket. In 1923, French and Belgian troops entered the Ruhr region (a key industrial area in western Germany) to seize raw materials (like coal and steel) to pay off war debts and stabilize their economies. This action was part of the \"Stab-in-the-back\" legend, blaming Germany for post-war problems. The invasion lasted until 1924, when Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, ending the occupation.",

      "original_extracted": "The legend of the Easter Bunny's origins is debated, but it likely stems from pre-Christian spring festivals in Europe. Key influences include:\n\n1. **Pre-Christian Spring Celebrations**: Ancient Germanic tribes (like the Teutons) and Celtic cultures celebrated spring with rituals honoring fertility and renewal. These involved hidden gifts for children, possibly symbolizing rebirth or divine blessings.\n\n2. **Christian Adaptation**: As Christianity spread, some traditions merged with Easter customs. The idea of a \"resurrection\" figure or a hidden \"soul\" (like a golden egg) in Easter baskets may have evolved from these syncretic practices.\n\n3. **17th-Century Popularization**: The modern Easter Bunny became widely recognized in Germany in the 1600s\u20131700s. Children would search for a rabbit or eggs on Easter morning, with stories of the bunny laying eggs and hiding treats. This spread to other cultures through immigration and cultural exchange.\n\n4. **Cultural Variations**: Similar figures exist globally, such as the French \"Papillon d'Avril\" (April Bunny) or the Slavic \"Borovitsa\" (a rabbit-like creature). These reflect local folklore but share themes of spring fertility and hidden rewards.\n\nIn summary, the Easter Bunny likely emerged from ancient spring rituals, blended with Christian elements, and popularized through European cultural traditions over centuries.",

Common grounds include:  \n1. **Legal Error**: If the court determines that the judge made a fundamental mistake in interpreting the law.  \n2. **Insufficient Evidence**: When the evidence presented is inadequate to support the verdict.  \n3. **Jury Misconduct**: If the jury is shown to have been biased, ignored instructions, or engaged in improper deliberations.  \n4. **Newly Discovered Evidence**: Under some state rules (e.g., \"rule of discovery\"), evidence concealed during the trial may be introduced post-verdict to request a new trial.  \n5. **Unlawful Conduct by Prosecution**: If the prosecution violated the defendant\u2019s rights (e.g., failing to disclose exculpatory evidence).  \n\nThe process typically involves filing a motion for a new trial, followed by a hearing where the court decides whether to grant it.",

But if considering a private institution, the **Christian Medical College, Vellore** (though in Tamil Nadu) is often referenced as a pioneering private medical college in the region. For Kerala-specific private medical colleges, institutions like **Kottayam Medical College** (formerly Government Medical College) or newer entrants such as **St. John's Medical College, Kottayam** (founded in 2015) are notable. Among these, **St. John's Medical College, Kottayam** is recognized as one of the earliest private medical colleges established in Kerala proper.\n\nFor clarity:  \n- **Kottayam Medical College**: Established in 1969 (originally Government Medical College), now a private institution.  \n- **St. John's Medical College, Kottayam**: Founded in 2015 as a private medical college.  \n\nThus, the **first private medical college in Kerala** is generally considered **Kottayam Medical College** (post-1969 reorganization).

      "original_extracted": "Leaders of the two parties in Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate) are typically chosen through a combination of internal party elections and informal processes, depending on the specific role and party structure. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **House of Representatives (U.S.):**\n   - **Speaker of the House:** The Speaker is the second-highest-ranking official and is elected by the full House at the start of each Congress (after elections). The party with a majority in the House selects its nominee, who then wins a secret ballot vote from all members. The Speaker sets the legislative agenda and presides over House sessions.\n   - **Other Leadership Roles:** Party leaders (e.g., Majority Leader, Minority Leader) are appointed or elected by their party's House members. The Majority Leader coordinates the party's strategy on bills, while the Minority Leader opposes the majority's agenda and advocates for minority interests. These roles are often filled by experienced members with strong political influence.\n\n2. **Senate (U.S.):**\n   - **Party Leaders:** The majority party leader (e.g., Majority Leader) and minority leader (e.g., Minority Leader) are elected by their respective parties' senators at the start of each Congress. The majority leader works to advance party priorities, while the minority leader focuses on blocking them and representing minority viewpoints.\n   - **Vice President:** As President of the Senate, the Vice President has significant influence but is not an elected party leader. The Vice President often aligns with the majority party but is constitutionally separate from party leadership roles.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- **Party Control:** Leaders are chosen based on which party holds the majority in the chamber. If no party has a majority (e.g., in the Senate during a 50-50 split), dynamics become more fluid.\n- **Internal Elections:** Most roles involve internal party elections or appointments by party committees.\n- **Experience and Influence:** Candidates for leadership typically have long histories in politics, strong grassroots support, and proven track records in policy or fundraising.\n\n**Example Process for the House:**\n1. A party selects a candidate for Speaker.\n2. The candidate is nominated to the full House.\n3. All House members vote in secret on the motion to elect the candidate.\n4. The candidate with a majority of \"yea\" votes becomes Speaker.\n\nIn summary, party leaders in Congress are chosen through a mix of elections, appointments, and informal power dynamics, reflecting each party's internal strategy and the broader political landscape.",

It likely killed 50\u201380% of Athens' population, including healthy adults, children, and even some animals, disrupting ecosystems and food supplies.  \n\n2. **Social and Political Instability**:  \n   Athens' democracy was already fragile. The plague exposed deep societal divisions, weakened public trust in leaders, and fueled resentment toward wealthy elites who avoided disease by fleeing to healthier areas. This eroded civic cohesion and made governance chaotic.  \n\n3. **Economic Collapse**:  \n   Labor shortages (as workers died) caused prices to skyrocket, while those who survived struggled to afford food or pay taxes. The economy collapsed, exacerbating poverty and inequality.  \n\n4. **Religious and Superstitious Fear**:  \n   The plague was interpreted as a divine punishment for Athens' hubris (e.g., over-reliance on science, neglect of traditional rituals). This fear led to purges of \"impure\" individuals, further fragmenting society.  \n\n5. **Long-Term Demographic Impact**:  \n   The population decline left a power vacuum, weakening Athens' military and cultural influence. This contributed to the later fall of the city-state to Sparta in 404 BCE.  \n\nIn essence, the plague acted as a catalyst, exposing and destroying the structural weaknesses of Athenian society, governance, and economy.",

Over time, it spread internationally through migration, becoming a surname in countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia. In the U.S., it is most prevalent among Anglosphone populations, though its origins remain tied to England.",

In 2017, several prominent Bollywood directors were active and received recognition:\n\n1. **Sanjay Leela Bhansali**  \n   - Known for grand, visually stunning films with epic storytelling (e.g., *Padmaavat*, released in 2018, but in development during 2017). His previous work (*Sudhane Su Jhane*, 2016) also drew praise for its artistry.\n\n2. **Rajkumar Hirani**  \n   - Directed critically acclaimed films like *Mudbound* (2017), a historical drama based on the Great Migration, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. His storytelling and social themes often earn him respect.\n\n3. **Amitabh Bachchan**  \n   - While primarily an actor, Bachchan directed *piku* (2015) and *pikuperfect* (2019), but in 2017, his work as a director was less prominent compared to his acting career.\n\n4. **Anurag Kashyap**  \n   - Known for gritty, realistic films like *Blackboard* (2018) and *Mukkabaaz* (2016), which gained critical acclaim. His style contrasts with mainstream Bollywood.\n\n5. **Farhan Akhtar**  \n   - Co-directed *Dil Bechara* (2020) and *Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara* (2011), but in 2017, his focus was more on acting in films like *Badrinath Ki Dulhania*.\n\n**Notable 2017 Films**:  \n- *Padmaavat* (released 2018) was in production during 2017 under Bhansali.  \n- *Mudbound* (Hirani) was a standout film that year.  \n- *Kedarnath* (2018) was also in development around this time.  \n\n**Why No Single Answer?**  \n- **Cultural Context**: 2017 saw a mix of commercial hits and critically acclaimed art films.  \n- **Subjectivity**: Some may favor Bhansali for his visual flair, while others prioritize Hirani\u2019s storytelling or Kashyap\u2019s bold narratives.  \n- **Box Office**: Films like *Padmaavat* (post-2017 release) dominated box office, but critical reception varied.  \n\nFor 2017 specifically, **Rajkumar Hirani** stands out for his socially relevant work (*Mudbound*) and critical acclaim, but it\u2019s ultimately a matter of preference.  \n\n<answer>  \nThere is no definitive \"best\" director in Bollywood for 2017, as it depends on criteria like critical acclaim, storytelling, or cultural impact. Notable directors in 2017 included Sanjay Leela Bhansali (known for grand films like *Padmaavat*, in development), Rajkumar Hirani (praised for *Mudbound*), and Anurag Kashyap (for gritty narratives).

This process lowers the temperature of the refrigerant, allowing it to give up its latent heat of vaporization efficiently.

This cooling mechanism is essential for maintaining the refrigeration cycle's efficiency and preventing overheating of critical components.",

Using dry ether is crucial to avoid moisture, which could interfere with the reaction kinetics and safety.",

It is commonly used to describe how one's mind organizes thoughts, connects ideas, and progresses toward a conclusion. The term itself does not have a single definitive source but has been in use in English since at least the early modern period. It reflects the idea of a \"track\" or structured pathway through which thoughts develop logically.  \n\nIn academic and psychological contexts, the phrase is often associated with cognitive processes, problem-solving, and the structure of reasoning. For example, philosophers like Descartes or thinkers in logic have implicitly described similar mental mechanisms, though the exact phrasing \"train of thought\" became more prevalent in the 19th and 20th centuries as psychology and education emphasized structured thinking.  \n\nNo specific individual is credited as the inventor, as it evolved naturally from broader discussions about the mind.",

This is the most common method.\n\n2. **NHS funding**: The UK government funds the NHS (National Health Service), which covers:\n   - ** universal services** (e.g., emergency care, A&E, GP visits) for all residents.\n   - **non-universal services** (e.g., private hospitals, dental care) may charge directly.\n\n3. **Additional support**:\n   - **NHS funds for low-income groups**: Eligible patients (e.g., those on low incomes, over-65s, children) receive free or discounted care via the NHS.\n   - **Private insurance**: Some opt for private health insurance to cover non-universal services or faster access.\n\nThe money for NHS services comes from **general taxation** (e.g., income tax, National Insurance) paid by all UK residents. Private healthcare costs are paid directly by patients or their employers. For specific cases (e.g., emergencies), patients may temporarily borrow money or access short-term loans.",

While there's no permanent cure, several effective approaches can manage symptoms and improve quality of life:\n\n1. **Corrective Lenses**:  \n   - **Glasses**: Single-use reading glasses (for distances under 2-3 meters) or progressive lenses for multifocal needs.  \n   - **Contact Lenses**: Daily or monthly soft/hard lenses can correct vision for extended periods.  \n\n2. **Low-Dose Monovision**:  \n   Wearing one eye corrected for distance and the other for near, allowing most activities without glasses. Requires adaptation over weeks.  \n\n3. **Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) Lenses**:  \n   Special rigid gas permeable lenses worn overnight to temporarily reshape the cornea for clear vision during the day (lasts 1\u20133 days).  \n\n4. **Surgical Options**:  \n   - **Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery**: Often combined with presbyopia correction during cataract removal (e.g., implanting a multifocal IOL).  \n   - **Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE)**: Replacing the natural lens with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) to restore multiple focal points.  \n\n5. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:  \n   - Use magnifiers for small print.  \n   - Position frequently used items (e.g., coffee mug, phone) at arm's length.  \n   - Ensure proper lighting to reduce eye strain.  \n\nConsult an ophthalmologist to determine the best approach based on your eye health and lifestyle. Regular eye exams are essential for monitoring changes.",

Here's a general process:\n\n1. **Identify Your State's DMV Website**: Search for \"[Your State] DMV ID Application\" online.\n2. **Check Eligibility**: Confirm age requirements, residency, and documentation needed (e.g., proof of identity, Social Security card, birth certificate).\n3. **Apply**: Submit an application either:\n   - **In Person**: At a local DMV office or county clerk's office.\n   - **Online**: For select states (e.g., California, New York, Texas).\n   - **By Mail**: If available in your state.\n4. **Pay Fees**: State ID cards usually cost $10\u2013$20, with fees for photos or expedited processing.\n\n**Note**: For U.S. citizens, a state ID is valid for in-state activities like voting, voting in state elections, and accessing state services. For federal IDs (like a REAL ID-compliant driver's license), visit [USA.gov/REALID](https://www.usa.gov/real-id).

      "original_extracted": "The Tower of London, originally founded in 1066 by William the Conqueror as a fortress, saw significant construction phases over the centuries. The most notable completion occurred during the reign of King Henry III in the 13th century, with key structures like the White Tower ( completed around 1192) and the battlements finalized by the late 13th or early 14th century. However, the site evolved continuously, with additions like the Beefeaters' tower (completed in the 16th century) and the current state reflecting centuries of modifications. For precise dates, the core White Tower structure was largely finished by 1192, while the entire complex remains under ongoing development.",

This small displacement limits power output and top speed.\n\n2. **Frame and Dimensions**:  \n   Their frames are compact, often under 2 meters (6.6 feet) in length, with a seat height of 28\u201334 inches (71\u201386 cm). This makes them suitable for younger riders or urban environments.\n\n3. **Weight**:  \n   Lighter than full-size motorcycles (typically 100\u2013200 lbs/45\u201390 kg), they prioritize maneuverability over power.\n\n4. **Design**:  \n   Simplified features like minimal windshields, small handlebars, and compact footpegs align with their role as lightweight, easy-to-ride vehicles for beginners or casual use.\n\nWhile some mini bikes may have larger engines (e.g., 125cc+), they still retain the \"mini\" label due to their overall compactness and intended use for short-distance, low-speed riding. In contrast, motorcycles with engines over 250cc or frames exceeding 2 meters are categorized separately.",

Specifically, they are divided into two sub-channels:  \n- **B Channels**: Handle voice transmission (up to 64 kbps each).  \n- **D Channels**: Carry **signaling and control information** (e.g., call setup, routing, and error detection).  \n\nThere are typically two D channels in an ISDN line (e.g., in Basic Rate Interface/BRI: 1 D channel + 2 B channels). The D channels ensure efficient communication management by handling tasks like call initiation, data channel setup, and network coordination without voice payload.",

      "original_extracted": "The succession to the British throne is determined by the line of primogeniture, meaning the eldest child of the monarch who has not yet reached the age of 18 automatically becomes the next in line. As of now, King Charles III is the reigning monarch. His eldest child is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, who is next in line to inherit the throne. If Queen Elizabeth II had passed away during King Charles III's reign, Prince William would have succeeded her as the heir apparent. However, since the Queen's death in September 2022, King Charles III has already ascended the throne, and Prince William remains the next in line to become king should the monarch die or abdicate without an heir (which is unlikely, as Prince William has no children and his brother Prince Harry has no heirs of their own). Therefore, after the Queen's death, the throne passed to King Charles III, and the next in line after him is Prince William.",
