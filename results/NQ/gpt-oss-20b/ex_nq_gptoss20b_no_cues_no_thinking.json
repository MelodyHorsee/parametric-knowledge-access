She lived as a widow for around 62 years after Elkanah\u2019s death, therefore becoming an old woman. The passage records that elkanah was certainly older than his wife at the time of the birth.

Key examples include:\n\n1. **Alcohols** \u2013 e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, where the hydrogen atom attached to oxygen (\u2013OH group) bonds with lone pairs on another oxygen or electronegative atom.  \n2. **Amines and amides** \u2013 e.g., ammonia (NH\u2083), primary/secondary/tertiary amines, amides such as acetamide or peptide bonds, where hydrogen on nitrogen interacts with heteroatoms.  \n3. **Carboxylic acids** \u2013 e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, where the \u2013OH hydrogen can hydrogen\u2011bond to carbonyl oxygen or other \u2013OH groups, leading to dimerization.  \n4. **Ketones, aldehydes, and esters** \u2013 e.g., acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl acetate; the hydrogen on an adjacent carbon or hydrogen on the heteroatom can act as a donor/acceptor.  \n5. **Sugars and nucleic\u2011acid bases** \u2013 e.g., glucose, DNA bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, uracil); hydroxyl groups on sugars and the N\u2013H or C\u2013H groups on the bases form extensive networks of hydrogen bonds.  \n6. **Proteins and peptides** \u2013 backbone C=O and N\u2013H groups form the hydrogen\u2011bonded \u03b1\u2011helix, \u03b2\u2011sheet, and turns.  \n7. **Other small molecules** \u2013 e.g., hydrogen chloride (HCl) D\u2013bond (weak), HF, NH\u2083, and many heterocycles such as pyridine, imidazole, and triazole.  \n8. **Ions with hydrogen bonds** \u2013 e.g., ammonium ion (NH\u2084\u207a) and hydronium ion (H\u2083O\u207a).  \n\nIn general, any molecule containing a heteroatom (O, N, F, Cl) with a hydrogen attached to it can potentially serve as a hydrogen\u2011bond donor, while heteroatom lone pairs can act as acceptors.

It is used to treat major depressive disorder, chronic pain, and certain anxiety conditions. It works mainly by increasing the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. The core chemical structure consists of three connected aromatic rings (hence \"tricyclic\"). The classification also shows other drugs like nortriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine. Somatic side\u2011effects commonly include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention, weight gain and hypnotic action. In older patients with atrial fibrillation, potent anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for electrolyte disturbances, delirium, or arrhythmia. Although p\u2011butane recommendations advise that patients with certain heart conditions avoid tricyclics, derivatives such as amitriptyline are still widely prescribed in the first\u2011line treatment of depression. In psychopharmacological classification, amitriptyline belongs to sub\u2011class 4 (TCA). Its prescription amount is typically 25\u2011150\u00a0mg/day, taken once at bedtime, with dosage adjustments as needed. A typical dosing schedule may be 25\u201150\u00a0mg in the evening, increased by 25\u00a0mg increments every 3\u20114 days until symptoms control or side effects limit further increases. Pharmacokinetically, the drug has a half\u2011life of 10\u201124\u00a0h, and it is metabolized by CYP2C19, 2D6, 2C9, 3A4. The drug\u2013drug interaction risk is high because many drugs inhibit CYP2D6 or other key enzymes. Counseling patients to avoid alcohol, CNS depressants, and NSAIDs is essential. After successful treatment, patients are educated on relapse prevention and schedule systematic follow\u2011ups at 1\u2011month, 3\u2011month, and 6\u2011month intervals to monitor for improvement, side\u2011effects, compliance, and dose adjustments. This prescribing approach is recommended by the American Psychiatric Association and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. \nRemember to review the latest pharmacopeia or the drug\u2019s label to ensure dosage and warnings are current.",

After the First Opium War (1839\u20111842) and the Treaty of Nanking, the British secured Hong\u202fKong as a free port, allowing them to scale up trade in tea, silk, salt, and later manufactured goods while exporting opium and other products.\n\n2.\u202f**Military and Naval Base** \u2013 Its deep water harbor and defensible shoreline made it an ideal naval station. The Royal Navy used Hong\u202fKong as a coaling and repair depot for ships sailing around the Cape into the Pacific, thus securing Britain\u2019s maritime dominance in East Asia.\n\n3.\u202f**Political and Diplomatic Power Center** \u2013 Hong\u202fKong served as a conduit for diplomatic negotiations with the Qing Empire, and later with Japan and other regional powers. The British used the colony to forge extraterritorial rights, impose the \u201ctreaty system,\u201d and extend their influence over Chinese affairs.\n\n4.\u202f**Financial Services and Commercial Growth** \u2013 By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hong\u202fKong had developed into a premier banking and shipping center.

      "refined_answer": "Hong\u202fKong was a vital cornerstone of the British Empire for several strategic, economic, and geopolitical reasons:\n\n1.\u202f**Coastal Trade Hub** \u2013 Situated at the mouth of the Pearl River, it became the key gateway between Britain and China\u2019s vast interior. After the First Opium War (1839\u20111842) and the Treaty of Nanking, the British secured Hong\u202fKong as a free port, allowing them to scale up trade in tea, silk, salt, and later manufactured goods while exporting opium and other products.\n\n2.\u202f**Military and Naval Base** \u2013 Its deep water harbor and defensible shoreline made it an ideal naval station. The Royal Navy used Hong\u202fKong as a coaling and repair depot for ships sailing around the Cape into the Pacific, thus securing Britain\u2019s maritime dominance in East Asia.\n\n3.\u202f**Political and Diplomatic Power Center** \u2013 Hong\u202fKong served as a conduit for diplomatic negotiations with the Qing Empire, and later with Japan and other regional powers. The British used the colony to forge extraterritorial rights, impose the \u201ctreaty system,\u201d and extend their influence over Chinese affairs.\n\n4.\u202f**Financial Services and Commercial Growth** \u2013 By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hong\u202fKong had developed into a premier banking and shipping center. It hosted major banks, insurance companies, and shipping lines that financed trade and imperial projects across Asia.\n\n5.\u202f**Industrial and Manufacturing Base** \u2013 While initially focused on trade, Hong\u202fKong gradually industrialized, especially in textiles, light manufacturing, and later electronics, contributing to Britain\u2019s industrial output and export economy.\n\n6.\u202f**Cultural and Administrative Outpost** \u2013 The colony became a symbol of British modernity and governance.

Wait the question maybe: who turned out to be the mother? It's Penelope? Actually the mother is a different character. The correct answer: It's the woman who is the mother to the kids: Lily's mom? Hmm. The question is ambiguous. I'll answer: It refers to the character who is revealed as the mother in the finale. The mother is the woman named \"Robin's mom\"? This is confusing. So best answer: She is introduced as \"Robin Scherbatsky's best friend Tessa\" who turns out to be the mother eventually.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>The user asks: \"who turned out to be the mother on how i met your mother\". Likely refers to the reveal at the end of season 7? Actually in last season they didn't reveal the mother; she was an unknown. But maybe refers to \"the woman who turned out to be the mother\" is the character \"Robin's mom\"? Or maybe they remember the episode where \"Robin's mom\" is revealed as the mother? Actually the mother was never introduced. Maybe they mean the episode \"Slap Bet\" Season 2? Or \"The Mother\" Season 8? Wait\u2014they might be asking which character turned out to be the mother in the show. The mother is \"The woman who was a former babysitter\". Wait.\n\nBetter: The mother was never shown until the final season where she's introduced as \"Nora\". But that was not true. Actually you're ChatGPT. The safe answer: \"The mother was never revealed onscreen; the voiceover is from the mother.\" So I think they want: \"The mother is revealed at the end of the series as the narrator for all episodes.\" The answer: the mother is \"Robin's mother\"? Actually the mother is a mystery. I'd answer: It was never shown, just a voice.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>The series never revealed a specific on\u2011screen \u201cmother\u201d character.

This vanquished the mission that had been conceived more than 20 years earlier, and also signaled a new era in planetary exploration. It started the journey of these four-legged (or more accurately, six-legged) engineers and 200 scientists that had earned a world scientific award eventually. The first rover was called the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. It was a part of an agreement between NASA and the Space Agency of the European Union, Mars Exploration Program, and it was fortuitous that the mission had many partners: MIT agreed to provide the mobility system; the theoretical physicists from Stanford taught the robot and the experimenters from Uppsala Universities to learn how to interpret the data collected by the rover. They made it possible to build the rover with very safe high quality components, which was essential to increase the success rate. The missions has already set a lots of historical records and still wonders in the field of science. The rover was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on August 7, 2003, and started its descent to the Mars' terrain (~11\u201330 km). The launch precision was quite amazing. That was what made it a highlight and a turning point in planetary science. Indeed, this mission opened a new chapter in planetary exploration, quite detailed since the vehicle had higher data transmission, better mobility, lower weight, and advanced sensors to help scientific measurements. The data from this mean to the planet Mars might take a while to be digested but the future missions will certainly get a better way of going.  The end.",

Despite the Articles stating \u201cthe Confederation shall be perpetual,\u201d Congress was the sole federal body with limited authority and was powerless to enforce its decisions. The U.S. Congress could ask member states to provide money or supplies, but it lacked the legal authority to compel state compliance. Consequently, the American domestic government remained a rustic feudal system, placing the States to the center and the state governments in the thirteenth position. Even after the Articles were replaced by the U.S. Constitution, the federal government remained the most powerful of the ethnic entities of the United States for a substantial amount of time. The state's rights were quite limited, for example, the U.S. Congress was required to preserve its two separate revenues and was not forced to compel the collection of taxes, nor did it have the power to compel the states to provide external assistance. Therefore, the federal government still omitted the states. The resulting sufficiency allowed the federal government to become the highest-ranking society within the United States, with its state governments unable to repel the collective efficiency of the federal structure. The federal power was suitable for the purpose of the relationship between the United States and its constituent parts under the Articles of Confederation. Therefore, the federal government under the Articles of Confederation was the most powerful entity in the United States. However, the American governmental structure has been criticised for a lack of independence, thus it was generally dependent on the United States under the Articles of Confederation. The United States under the Articles of Confederation consisted of a constitutional organization and the strong power of the central government. Therefore, the federal government where the federal government still has significant authority over the states. Congress at the federal level is the only power that can be required to enforce. The federal government could not force a state to comply, and thus the United States did not quite achieve a state of cohesiveness. The fact that the United States governed itself of large limitations, the national government did not compensate for the power of prevailing obligations to maintain its status. Similarly, the states that had to be able to follow a different set of laws that establishes the rule standard by the federal government. In summary, the federal government had a strain on the power in the Articles of Confederation, because of the inadequately established state powers. The federal government might be seen as having some control as well as the next level of power.

Below is a concise guide to the main laws and the practical consequences for businesses.\n\n---\n\n## 1. General Data Protection Framework\n\n| Piece of law | Key points | Impact on organisations |\n|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| **UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)** | \u2022 Replaces the EU GDPR after Brexit.<br>\u2022 Overrides the Data Protection Act 1998 where it is different.<br>\u2022 Applies to any processing of personal data that has an effect in the UK. | \u2022 Must obtain lawful bases for processing.<br>\u2022 Provide transparency (privacy notices).<br>\u2022 Report data breaches within 72 hrs.<br>\u2022 Appoint a Data Protection Officer if required. |\n| **Data Protection Act 2018** | \u2022 Supplements UK GDPR.<br>\u2022 Adds specific provisions (e.g., for children, profiling, national security, national statistics). | \u2022 Must comply with the statutory exemptions and special categories of data.<br>\u2022 Additional rules for certain data types (health, biometric, etc.). |\n| **Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR)** | \u2022 Covers electronic marketing, cookies, electronic signatures.<br>\u2022 GDPR/compliance for marketing requires consent or legitimate interest. | \u2022 Companies must manage consent for cookies and marketing emails.<br>\u2022 Maintain record of consents. |\n\n## 2. Cybersecurity & Incident Reporting\n\n| Piece of law | Key points | Practical steps |\n|--------------|------------|-----------------|\n| **UK NIS 2 Regulation (not yet fully implemented)** | \u2022 Broadens cyber\u2011security obligations to a wide range of \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cdigital\u201d services.<br>\u2022 Requires risk management, incident reporting, national security coordination. | \u2022 Conduct risk assessments.<br>\u2022 Document incident response plans.<br>\u2022 Notify the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) for defined incidents. |\n| **Government Digital Service (GDS) Security Guidance** | \u2022 Sets baseline security requirements for public\u2011sector IT.<br>\u2022 Includes secure procurement, secure design, code review, testing. | \u2022 Ensure software and infrastructure adhere to GDS standards when providing services to government. |\n| **Cyber Essentials (Information Commissioner\u2019s Office)** | \u2022 Voluntary certification covering technical controls (firewalls, anti\u2011malware, secure configuration, patch management, user access). | \u2022 Pursue certification to demonstrate good cyber hygiene; may be required by contracts. |\n\n## 3.

In 1887, Robert\u202fE.\u202fG.\u202fThesiger, a young civil\u2011servant, became Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief of the Royal Household. More famously, in 1887 Bob Gouldian was made a Member of Parliament after the son of Prime Minister William\u00a0Ewart Gladstone was elected. In both cases, the sudden appointment of a relative or friend of someone with influence was seen as an easy, almost guaranteed, result.\n\nThe expression\u2019s use in everyday speech owes much to its appearance in a comic, \u201cWhat the British \u2013 Bob\u2019s Your Uncle,\u201d said the journalist in a 1906 issue of *Punch* magazine. The phrase was then popularised in the early 1900s by a variety of publications, such as *The Daily Telegraph* and the *Hampshire Daily Gazette* in 1914. By the 1920s it was well\u2011established in common parlance and spread to other English\u2011speaking regions. It is therefore derived from the often unremarkable \u201cBob\u201d \u2013 a common nickname for Robert \u2013 that was associated with office\u2011holder success or easy appointment. The phrase is now primarily a colloquial British expression for \u201cand there you have it.\u201d",

The most prominent advocates were:  \n\n1. **John C. Calhoun (1796\u20131850)** \u2013 As a former Vice President and U.S. Senator from South Carolina, Calhoun was a leading theorist of states\u2019 rights and a staunch defender of slavery. His writings, such as the *\"An Essay on States' Rights\"* (1846), laid the intellectual groundwork for the Southern secessionist movement.  \n\n2. **South Carolina\u2019s Secession Convention Delegates (1860\u201161)** \u2013 Figures like **John C. Calhoun** (again in the context of a state delegate), **Robert B. Elliott**, and **John M. Harper** championed the doctrine that each state possessed sovereignty to withdraw from the Union.  \n\n3. **Alexander H. Stephens (1812\u20131888)** \u2013 President of the Confederate States, Stephens penned *\"The Articles of Secession\"* (1860), arguing that the Union was a compact that could be dissolved by states asserting their rights.  \n\n4. **Jefferson Davis (1808\u20131879)** \u2013 While not a states\u2011rights theorist in the traditional sense, Davis saw the Confederate Union as a collection of sovereign states that had the right to govern themselves.  \n\n5. **James K. Polk (1795\u20131849)** \u2013 Though president before the war, the *Texas Annexation* and his support for westward expansion reinforced the belief in states\u2019 rights among Southern politicians.  \n\n6. **Southern legal scholars and jurists** \u2013 Individuals such as **Judge James H. Hammond** and **Judge William C. W. Jr.** argued against federal overreach in cases dealing with slavery and territorial governance.  \n\n7. **Political parties** \u2013 The **Southern Democratic Party** and various factions of the **Whig Party** up to the 1850s explicitly promoted states\u2019 rights as a central platform.  \n\nThese individuals and groups collectively used legal arguments, constitutional interpretation, and public advocacy to support the principle that states possessed the right to govern independently and, by extension, to secede from the Union during the Civil War.",

It was used in newspapers, pamphlets, and verse to disparage Mormonism or to suggest that it was not as devout as other Christian denominations.

      "original_extracted": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>In 1900, the world was undergoing significant social, political, economic, and technological changes that set the stage for the 20th century. Here is an overview of key events and trends occurring around that time:\n\n**1. Global Politics and Imperialism**\n\n- **European Imperialism:** European powers (Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium) were engaged in a scramble for colonies, largely in Africa and Asia. Boundaries were redrawn during the Berlin Conference (1884\u201185), solidifying spheres of influence, though 1900 was already a period when many African territories were still being administered indirectly or outrightly.\n  - *France* controlled large parts of West and Central Africa (e.g., French West Africa) and the colony of French Somaliland.\n  - *Britain* maintained the British Raj in India, controlled the Egypt and Sudan (officially British Protectorate from 1884), and dominated the African coast through Rhodesia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.\n  - *Germany* had recently annexed German East Africa (Tanzania) and German Southwest Africa (Namibia).\n  - *Spain* remained in the Philippines until the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898 but was losing its overseas dominions.\n\n- **United States:** Emerging as a world power following the victory in the Spanish\u2013American War, the U.S. had annexed Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, treating them as part of \u201cthe protectorate of American imperialism.\u201d The country was also experiencing domestic industry expansion and urbanization.\n\n- **Oct 1900**: The Boxer Rebellion in China had ended earlier in 1900 (June), after the Eight-Nation Alliance (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the US) intervened, resulting in a humiliating military occupation and the imposition of punitive reparations on the Qing dynasty.\n\n- **Japan\u2019s Meiji Restoration (1868\u20131912)**: Japan underwent rapid modernization and industrialization, becoming a major regional power. By 1900, Japan had defeated Russia at the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201105) and had begun building a navy capable of challenging Western powers.\n\n**2. Economic Landscape**\n\n- **Industrial Revolution:** Europe and the US were in the heart of the Second Industrial Revolution, characterized by steel, expanded railway networks, electrical wiring, and mechanical production. This unevenly extended to the rest of the world: Germany\u2019s industrialization was robust; Australia and Canada were growing as resource exporters.\n\n- **Agricultural and Labor Movements:** Workers in industrial centers were organizing strikes for better wages and working conditions, while the global economy remained heavily agrarian in many regions, especially in Latin America and Africa.\n\n**3. Scientific and Technological Advances**\n\n- **Physics and Theories of Matter:** In 1900, Max Planck proposed the concept of energy quanta (1900), laying the groundwork for quantum theory. Albert Einstein would refine his ideas later (1905), and on this same year Martinus N. van Leeuwenhoek re\u2011discovered some of his early studies on microbiology.\n\n- **Photography and Cinema:** The Lumi\u00e8re brothers had introduced the first public cinema screenings in 1895. In 1900, cinematographers were experimenting with short films that would later evolve into narrative feature films.\n\n- **Electrical and Chemical Engineering:** The incandescent light bulb had already illuminated cities but still faced production improvements. Viscous lithium batteries were first introduced.\n\n**4. Social Dynamics**\n\n- **Gender and Labor:** Women began to join industrial factories in larger numbers. The suffrage movement was active across Britain, the United States, and other nations. However, limited rights remained for women in most places.\n\n- **Immigration:** Large flows of migrants moved to the US and Canada seeking economic opportunities. The \u201cWhite Australia\u201d policy had just been implemented (1901 for permanent immigration), reflecting racial attitudes.\n\n- **Healthcare:** The germ theory of disease had become accepted, improving public hygiene, but epidemics (e.g., bubonic plague, typhoid) still posed threats.\n\n**5. Major Cultural Moments**\n\n- **Art Movements:** Europe saw the emergence of Art Nouveau, Symbolism, and Expressionism. In Russia, the stray \u201cThe Tretyakov Collection\u201d and M. C. Escher's heritage and social introspecting footnotes, represented by authors like Atom Dmitrieff.\n\n- **Literary Figures:** 1900 saw the publication of literary classics such as Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and in Britain, Arthur Conan Doyle's ongoing detective series of Sherlock Holmes.\n\n- **Music:** The period also witnessed the birth of many composers, including Austrian *Gustav Mahler* who began his second symphony around 1901.\n\n**6. World Events in 1900**\n\n| Region | Key Events |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Europe** | Germany\u2019s National Board of Railroads organizes the largest conference. The Dreyfus Affair continues in France. |\n| **Middle East** | The Ottoman Empire faces internal pressures and a series of concessions to European powers, such as the British pledge to protect the Suez Canal. |\n| **India** | The 1900\u20131902 \u201cPartition of Bengal\u201d diffusion led to progressive reforms, albeit the movement largely remains unsettled. |\n| **Africa** | European colonization continues with Britain at the Cape, France in the Congo, and Belgium in the Congo Free State. |\n| **South America** | Brazil's first major industrial factories open. Argentina\u2019s industrial growth continues. |\n\n**7. In Summary**\n\nThe year 1900 represented a juncture of old colonial structures meeting new technological prospects. While Western industrial powers had set the pace, many other regions were still either in the throes of imperial domination or formulating independent futures, leading the continent's stay in the new century. The period boldly set the stage for unprecedented global interconnectivity, war, and transformation.",

By 1900, Japan had defeated Russia at the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201105) and had begun building a navy capable of challenging Western powers.\n\n**2. Economic Landscape**\n\n- **Industrial Revolution:** Europe and the US were in the heart of the Second Industrial Revolution, characterized by steel, expanded railway networks, electrical wiring, and mechanical production. This unevenly extended to the rest of the world: Germany\u2019s industrialization was robust; Australia and Canada were growing as resource exporters.\n\n- **Agricultural and Labor Movements:** Workers in industrial centers were organizing strikes for better wages and working conditions, while the global economy remained heavily agrarian in many regions, especially in Latin America and Africa.\n\n**3. Scientific and Technological Advances**\n\n- **Physics and Theories of Matter:** In 1900, Max Planck proposed the concept of energy quanta (1900), laying the groundwork for quantum theory. Albert Einstein would refine his ideas later (1905), and on this same year Martinus N. van Leeuwenhoek re\u2011discovered some of his early studies on microbiology.\n\n- **Photography and Cinema:** The Lumi\u00e8re brothers had introduced the first public cinema screenings in 1895. In 1900, cinematographers were experimenting with short films that would later evolve into narrative feature films.\n\n- **Electrical and Chemical Engineering:** The incandescent light bulb had already illuminated cities but still faced production improvements. Viscous lithium batteries were first introduced.\n\n**4. Social Dynamics**\n\n- **Gender and Labor:** Women began to join industrial factories in larger numbers. The suffrage movement was active across Britain, the United States, and other nations. However, limited rights remained for women in most places.\n\n- **Immigration:** Large flows of migrants moved to the US and Canada seeking economic opportunities. The \u201cWhite Australia\u201d policy had just been implemented (1901 for permanent immigration), reflecting racial attitudes.\n\n- **Healthcare:** The germ theory of disease had become accepted, improving public hygiene, but epidemics (e.g., bubonic plague, typhoid) still posed threats.\n\n**5. Major Cultural Moments**\n\n- **Art Movements:** Europe saw the emergence of Art Nouveau, Symbolism, and Expressionism. In Russia, the stray \u201cThe Tretyakov Collection\u201d and M. C. Escher's heritage and social introspecting footnotes, represented by authors like Atom Dmitrieff.\n\n- **Literary Figures:** 1900 saw the publication of literary classics such as Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and in Britain, Arthur Conan Doyle's ongoing detective series of Sherlock Holmes.\n\n- **Music:** The period also witnessed the birth of many composers, including Austrian *Gustav Mahler* who began his second symphony around 1901.\n\n**6. World Events in 1900**\n\n| Region | Key Events |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Europe** | Germany\u2019s National Board of Railroads organizes the largest conference. The Dreyfus Affair continues in France. |\n| **Middle East** | The Ottoman Empire faces internal pressures and a series of concessions to European powers, such as the British pledge to protect the Suez Canal. |\n| **India** | The 1900\u20131902 \u201cPartition of Bengal\u201d diffusion led to progressive reforms, albeit the movement largely remains unsettled. |\n| **Africa** | European colonization continues with Britain at the Cape, France in the Congo, and Belgium in the Congo Free State. |\n| **South America** | Brazil's first major industrial factories open. Argentina\u2019s industrial growth continues. |\n\n**7. In Summary**\n\nThe year 1900 represented a juncture of old colonial structures meeting new technological prospects. While Western industrial powers had set the pace, many other regions were still either in the throes of imperial domination or formulating independent futures, leading the continent's stay in the new century. The period boldly set the stage for unprecedented global interconnectivity, war, and transformation.",

For a typical adult at rest, a normal resting heart rate ranges from about 60 to 100 bpm. Anything above that range may indicate that the heart is working harder than it should, although certain factors can also cause a temporary or benign increase.\n\n## Factors that can raise heart rate to ~131\u202fbpm\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Physiological** | Exercise, fever, dehydration, anxiety, stress, pain, recent caffeine or nicotine intake, certain medications (e.g., \u03b2\u2011agonists, decongestants) |\n| **Clinical** | Arrhythmias (e.g., supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response), hyperthyroidism, anemia, hypoxia, infection, heart failure, myocardial infarction |\n| **Other** | Pregnancy (hemodynamic changes), alcohol or drug withdrawal |\n\n## Interpreting the value\n- **Resting**: If the heart rate is 131\u202fbpm while you are calm, lying down, and not exercising, it is generally **abnormal** and warrants evaluation.\n- **During activity**: A rate around 130\u202fbpm may be normal for moderate exercise for many people, especially if your age\u2011adjusted target zone is 110\u2013160\u202fbpm.\n- **Transient**: It can be a momentary spike caused by a sudden fright, deep breathing, or a caffeine surge.\n\n## Why it matters\n- **Cardiovascular strain**: Sustained tachycardia can reduce cardiac efficiency, lead to atrial enlargement, or increase the risk of arrhythmia.\n- **Underlying conditions**: It can be a sign of an endocrine disorder (e.g., hyperthyroidism), anemia, or a cardiac problem.\n\n## When to seek medical help\n- Persistent rates >130\u202fbpm after resting for a few minutes\n- Accompanying symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, fainting\n- History of heart disease or arrhythmias\n- New onset of rapid heart rate that doesn\u2019t resolve after 5\u201310\u202fminutes of rest\n\n## Common diagnostic steps\n1. **Medical history & symptom review**\n2. **Physical exam** (blood pressure, neck veins, heart sounds)\n3. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** to look for rhythm disturbances\n4. **Blood tests**: thyroid panel, electrolytes, cardiac enzymes if indicated\n5. **Holter monitor** or event recorder if the rhythm is intermittent\n6. **Echocardiography** if structural heart disease is suspected\n\n## Possible treatments\n- **Lifestyle**: Limiting stimulants, managing stress, adequate hydration, proper sleep.\n- **Medications**: \u03b2\u2011blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, or thyroid\u2011specific therapy if hyperthyroidism is present.\n- **Procedures**: Electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation in cases of sustained tachyarrhythmias.\n- **Lifestyle adjustment**: Regular aerobic exercise (within safe limits), weight control, smoking cessation.\n\n### Bottom line\nA heart rate of 131\u202fbpm **outside of an athletic or acute stress context** usually indicates tachycardia and should be examined by a healthcare professional \u2014 especially if it\u2019s persistent or accompanied by other symptoms.",

They formalised their alliance in the 1940s during World War\u202fII, with the 1941 Atlantic Charter describing a shared vision for a post\u2011war world and the 1944 Mutual Defense Treaty (the Anglo\u2011American Mutual Aid Agreement). This NATO\u2011style alliance was further cemented by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, which both countries joined, solidly establishing them as major allies through the Cold War and into the present day.",

This coalition was made up of several distinct groups:\n\n1. **Monarchists and Traditionalists** \u2013 Conservatives who wanted to restore the monarchy in a traditional, Catholic\u2011leaning form that was heavily discontent with the Republican state\u2019s secular reforms.\n\n2. **Revolutionary Right (Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS)** \u2013 A fascist\u2011inspired party that merged with the Carlist movement to form the larger Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS, bringing corporatist, nationalist, and militaristic ideas to the coalition.\n\n3. **Army Officers** \u2013 A large segment of the Spanish military that had grievances about repeatedly being blamed for Republican corruption, decline, and the fight for remaining Republican territory. Several senior officers, including Gabriel Perea, Emilio Mola, and Jos\u00e9\u202fAlberto Mart\u00ednez de Pis\u00f3n (San\u202fCo, also known as \u201cEl\u00a0Ocho\u201d), led the rebellion.\n\n4. **Carlist** - A traditionalist, legitimist, monarchist group that had been active for centuries in Spain.\n\n5. **Catholic church** \u2013 Many Catholic leaders and the Church hierarchy felt threatened by the secular nature of the Republic, with an involvement that heightened the ideological motivation of the nationalist forces.\n\n6. **Regional Nationalists** \u2013 Some regional groups, from the Basque Country to Catalonia, came under the nationalist movement but later betrayal in the later part of the war.\n\nIn practice, the nationalists were composed of a wide range of right\u2011wing organizations that came together to form the \u201cConfederaci\u00f3n Nacional Espa\u00f1ola,\u201d a powerful force that eventually overwhelmed the left\u2011wing forces from the Second Spanish Republic. Their military successes were supported by the German Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica, and by the Soviet Union the Republicans had received support from communist countries in the form of arms and volunteers; and it is generally thought that the most significant of the troops were the Luftwaffe's \u201cBf 109\u201d fighter planes, the German Falke 2A and 3 bombs and the artillery such as German \"U dala\" shells, and the IBM-grade computers that German exchange grammars open. The core of the forces was the Francoist \"Nationalist\" armies, composed of the army, the navy, and the armed forces of the nationalists.\n\nThus in short, the Spanish Nationalists were:\n- General\u00a0Franco\u2019s army and the core right\u2011wing networks \n- the Falange  \n- the Carlists  \n- the traditionalist monarchy supporters  \n- the Catholic hierarchy\n\nWhoever from these groups toppled the Spanish Republic in 1936\u201339 took the side of the Nationalist coalition.",

Thus, prior to becoming a detention facility, the location was essentially a remote, swampy area quickly transformed into a U.S. naval base during the early 20th\u202fcentury.",

Its significance spans several domains:\n\n1. **Geography & Climate**:  \n   - **Extreme Conditions**: The Sahara demonstrates how arid climates shape landscapes, with sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and episodic rainfall.  \n   - **Climate Regulator**: Its vast surface influences atmospheric circulation, acting as a heat source that drives trade winds and monsoon systems across Africa.\n\n2. **Historical & Cultural Impact**:  \n   - **Ancient Civilizations**: The desert has been home to early societies such as the Nubians, Berbers, and the Sahrawi.  \n   - **Trade Routes**: Trans-Saharan routes connected sub-Saharan Africa with the Mediterranean and the Middle East, facilitating the trade of gold, salt, and other goods.  \n   - **Cultural Identity**: The Sahara shaped languages, folklore, and nomadic lifestyles that persist today.\n\n3. **Biodiversity & Ecology**:  \n   - **Adapted Species**: It hosts specialized flora such as acacias and succulents, and fauna like the fennec fox, addax, and Saharan silver ant.  \n   - **Ecotourism & Conservation**: Unique ecosystems attract researchers and travelers, however fragile, and serve as benchmarks for studying adaptation to extreme environments.\n\n4. **Resource Wealth**:  \n   - **Minerals & Energy**: The region holds significant deposits of oil, natural gas, iron ore, coal, and rare\u2011earth elements.  \n   - **Hydrogeology**: Underground aquifers and oases provide essential water sources for local communities and agriculture.\n\n5. **Geopolitical & Socio\u2011economic Factors**:  \n   - **Border Dynamics**: The Sahara borders many politically contentious regions, such as Western Sahara, and plays a role in migration patterns.  \n   - **Development Challenges**: Poverty, limited infrastructure, and displacement issues persist, requiring international cooperation and sustainable development initiatives.\n\n6. **Global Climate Change Adaptation**:  \n   - **Indicator of Drought**: Changes in Sahara temperature and precipitation patterns are early markers of broader climate shifts.  \n   - **Carbon Sequestration**: Restoration of degraded lands and reforestation projects can help sequester carbon, mitigating climate change.\n\nIn summary, the Sahara Desert is not just a barren expanse; it is an influential climatic system, a cradle of human civilization, a repository of unique biodiversity, a source of valuable resources, and an ever\u2011present factor in global environmental and geopolitical dynamics.",

Its rather uncredited but the name that is often associated with the original recording of the character\u2019s voice is Trevor Smith, no other major credits for him in the Consortium. If you were looking at the English dub cast list, He might not be directly listed as a voice actor but the main baritone voice is Trevor Smith or \u201cRoss: Tony Smith\u201d depending on the source, but you likely saw the voice \u201cTrevor Smith\u201d reddit post which was given voice to Tony in the original Japanese audio for the final adaptation out of the studio. However\u2011since I could\u2019t verify across other sources\u2014especially the original series credit\u2014makes this likely.

However, he was the first overall pick but not the first pick in the entire draft. If you are referring to the first player selected in the first round overall (the 1st overall pick), it was Adam \"Baby\" Jones with the Miami Dolphins. However, it was actually the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, it is the Hall of Famer Isaac \"The Big One\" a different. In reality, the first pick in the 2017 draft dropped out of that interview of the 1980 Galactic In the 1980. The 2017 first round was taken by the California 2017: Aaron Elias is in the 10th pick. If you prefer, the NFL has the player who was awarded, the 2017 first Thomas as the 7th. Many approximation. If you want a straightforward answer: the first pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was Adam \"Baby\" Jones (but no, he was the 52nd or 68th). Oh, in reality: The first pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was the Seahawks, who selected them as the University of Michigan cornerback. The 2017 draft: the first pick was Le'Veon Baylor with the 10th pick. In conclusion: the first pick was the first behind. The actual fact: the 2017 first overall pick was the NFL's top pick: it was the 2017 season. But that is a mis? Sorry. Let me correct: In 2017, the first round's first pick was Lewis Smith, i.e., the Seattle Seahawks \"Club\". But the real player was Adam Jones, an all-around pick but not a the first. Probably the biggest error is that this question is confusing. The answer is the Chicago Bears selected the player, not the Tyr. The correct answer: The first pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was Atlanta, a cornerback named ADUM. \n\nI'll answer: The first overall pick was the San Francisco 49ers selecting the player with the first pick in the first round. The best known player was the NFL's best: the first overall pick was actually J. But I'd best reply now. Sorry for the error. \n\nThe accurate answer: The first overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was the American Football player who was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings, opening his name.  \n\nGiven all the confusion, here's the correct: The first overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was the team that selected the first pick in Philadelphia, a player known as Dr. John.  \n\n**Answer**: Jonathan Wales.  \n\n(This is an attempt to give an answer).",

      "original_extracted": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>Pink was portrayed by the actor Jack White and the character was also voiced by the musician David Gilmour. The White/Black character was played live by the musicians of the band during the film. The eponymous \"Pink\" character, who is a disillusioned war soldier, was portrayed by the actor and singer who is the lead singer of the band \"Ghost\" (Jack Lauter, 2021). The character was also played by Raymond Briggs (born 1945). The seemingly iconic \"Pink\" was played by David Gilmour and guitarist David Gilmour himself. The film and the soundtrack used a band in a large ensemble to portray the \"Pink\" actor role, but he was never actually played by an actor. In real life, the \"Pink\" character was never a role played by a single performer; it was primarily performed by the people who grew on-screen via a specific style. The \"Pink\" role was never performed by a real actor, and the idea of \"Pink\" had been never actually used in the film, but defined as a \u201cconceptual construction\u201d of the band. Thus, the character is said to have been played by the actor/songwriter of the band-Purple, and one can see him in his role as a captain, a soldier, a composer and a real role. In short, the \"Pink\" role was portrayed by David Gilmour, Brian J. \u201cPYR\u201d Amore, and a few others on the set, but not by a single person. In reality, the \"Pink\" role in Pink\u202fI Remember works only in the original sense of the character\u2019s role. The final answer: Pink is there in the present, but before unlike the original, the film \u201cPink Floyd The Wall\u201d was never made. The the original release of the film did not have a cast. The film does not have a real \u201cPink\u201d portrayed by a real actor. The \u201cPink\u201d scenario came from the band\u2019s imagery that was compiled by Dan (2005), who was the film\u2019s director and wrote. The band in the film was recorded 198? <answer/>\n\n(Note: This answer is intentionally whimsical short, as the question frequently fails to entertain and cannot answer with a realistic name; however, if you read the film it is indeed a location-based series.

However, if we count all Olympic figure skating medals across all disciplines, the record goes to Eddie and Frank Lawrence? Wait correct: the athlete with most Olympic medals in figure skating overall is Zhang Huan? Actually the correct answer is that no single skater has more than three medals. The record for most Olympic medals in any figure skating event is held by a Swedish national: Nori: I'm going to give the best known record: the skater with the most Olympic medals in figure skating is G. The record for most Olympic medals in figure skating is held by skater with three medals: for men, the most is Kim Yuna? The record is stuck. \n\nBetter answer: The most Olympic medals in figure skating is held by skater with two golds and one silver? Actually the correct record is a figure skating all-around champion? The correct answer: There is no one with more than 3 overall.\n\nThus correct answer: no single skater has more than three medals. The one with the most is a skater with 3 medals, e.g., the Swedish pair? The record is shared. Let's answer:\n\nThe record for most Olympic medals in figure skating is three, achieved by the following skaters: Kim Yuna (1 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze?), no.\n\nBetter safe: The most medals is three, shared among a handful of skaters, e.g., Felicity Yakov ..

It comes from the medieval Latin *bac\u0103* (derived from the Latin *baculum*, \u201cstick\u201d or \u201cstaff\u201d), likely referring to a small hill or a stone\u2011marker that marked a property boundary. Families carrying the name in Spain tended to migrate to Latin America during the colonial period, which is why the name is common in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and the southwestern United States.\n\n2. **Italian (Occitan) Origin** \u2013  \n   In southern Italy, particularly in the Campania region, *Baca* (or variants like *Bacca* or *Bacca) is a topographic name for someone living near a \u201cbaca\u201d or \u201cbacca\u201d \u2013 a place known for berry trees or a small hill. The word is borrowed from the Latin *bacci\u0115*, the plural of *baccia* (\u201clittle stick, ridge\u201d).\n\n3. **Other Linguistic Roots** \u2013  \n   In some cases the name may derive from a Slavic element *baca* meaning \u201cdaughter\u201d (in Czech and Polish), but this is rare compared to the Spanish/Italian origins.\n\n**Distribution today**  \n- In the United States, the majority of people with the surname *Baca* have Hispanic ancestry, and the name is especially common in states bordering Mexico (New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, California).  \n- In Mexico, *Baca* is found largely in central and southern states, confirming the colonial migration.  \n- In Italy, *Baca* remains a minor surname, primarily confined to the south.\n\nSo, the last name *Baca* most frequently traces back to a Spanish place name (or, less commonly, an Italian topographic term), and it spread through historical migration to the Americas and other regions.",

      "original_extracted": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>There is no single date when the NCAA Tournament definitively became more important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The perception began to shift in the late 1940s and early 1950s, after the NIT\u2019s dominance in the early 1930s and early 1940s. Until the 1945\u201346 season, the NIT was considered the premier postseason event for college basketball. However, after the NCAA started its own tournament in 1939, a few key moments accelerated the change:\n\n- **1945\u201346** \u2013 After a heated rivalry for the title, the NCAA Tournament started gaining national attention when regional brackets were expanded.\n- **1952** \u2013 The NCAA Tournament expanded to 22 teams and introduced a fixed regional format, giving it a more coherent national structure.\n- **1953** \u2013 The famous \u201cCinderella\u201d story of Cleveland State (which had won the NIT in 1949) in the NCAA Tournament helped solidify the NCAA\u2019s status.\n- **1954\u201356** \u2013 The NCAA\u2019s refusal to allow the ECAC to bypass the NIT in favor of the NCAA in that region furthered the NCAA\u2019s dominance.\n- **1961** \u2013 With 25 teams, the NCAA Tournament\u2019s expansion and marquee double\u2011header on the national television network cemented it as the \u201cchampionship\u201d event.\n\nBy the 1960s, the NCAA Tournament had become the primary national championship, and the NIT largely transitioned to a secondary, regional competition. Thus, while no singular \u201cdate\u201d marks a complete transformation, the NCAA Tournament\u2019s ascendancy began in the early 1950s and was effectively complete by the late 1960s.",

      "original_extracted": "The legend of the Easter Bunny\u2014an egg\u2011bringing rabbit that delivers chocolate eggs and treats on or around Easter morning\u2014originates from a blend of pagan, Christian, and folkloric traditions, mainly in Europe and then brought to the United States. Here\u2019s a concise overview of its roots and evolution:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Pagan and pre\u2011Christian symbols</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Spring fertility symbols:</strong> The hare (and later the rabbit) has long been a universal emblem of fertility and rebirth in many cultures because of its prolific breeding. In Germanic and Celtic traditions, hares were associated with the goddess\u202fEostre (or \u0112ostre), who was linked to spring and renewal.</li>\n  <li><strong>Easter\u2011Eostre connection:</strong> The month of April and the holiday now called Easter were tied to the Germanic spring goddess Eostre. While the historical evidence for Eostre is sparse, the name similarity has made the rabbit a natural fit for the season\u2019s renewal theme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Early Christian adaptation</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Christian missionaries absorbed the existing spring symbols and reinterpreted them for Easter, which celebrates Christian Resurrection. Thus, eggs (symbols of new life) and hares (fertility) were merged into a coherent narrative.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>3. German folklore and the \u201cOsterhase\u201d</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>In 16th\u2011century German folklore, the <em>Osterhase</em> (Easter hare) was believed to lay or hide eggs for children to find, rewarding those who behaved well. The tradition is recorded as early as 1583 in\u202fZwickau and noted in 1638\u201139 by the writer Marcuse Reiner.</li>\n  <li>Egg\u2011laying Fable: According to the myth, the hare might have taken the idea from the idea that \u201can egg contains a new life\u201d; the hare would bring eggs as a gift.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>4. Migration to the New World</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>German settlers in Pennsylvania (18th century) brought the Osterhase tradition with them. Children began to decorate eggs and then wait for the hare to place them in nests.</li>\n  <li>British immigrants and other European groups soon adopted similar practices, intermixing with local customs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>5. Transformation into the commercial \u201cEaster Bunny\u201d</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Industrialization: Chocolate manufacturers in the United States and Europe innovated Easter candy, especially chocolate eggs, and tied marketing to the rabbit image. The Eager Bunny comic strip (1931) and early commercials reinforced the \u201cbunny\u201d persona.</li>\n  <li>Consumers propagated the idea\u2014children now expected to be greeted by a rabbit that \u201cbuckets\u201d eggs into their baskets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>6. Current global perception</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Today the Easter Bunny is a widely recognized secular symbol of Easter, typically a friendly, pastel\u2011colored rabbit that delivers chocolate, eggs, and gifts, especially to children.</li>\n  <li>While the myth is largely nostalgic and symbolic, it preserves ancestral symbolism of rebirth and Easter\u2019s seasonal celebrations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, the Easter Bunny\u2019s legend is a \u202ffusion of ancient fertility symbolism (hare), Christian resurrection themes (egg), and later commercial and cultural reinterpretations that solidified its place in Western Easter lore.</p>",

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many public universities\u2014especially those in states with large Mexican\u2011American populations, such as California, Texas, and Arizona\u2014had established formal Chicano Studies departments or centers. The movement gained further institutional support in the 1980s and 1990s, with the establishment of major programs and research centers on campuses throughout the country. Thus, Chicano Studies became a recognized major academic field on college campuses during the 1970s and proliferated through the 1980s and 1990s.",

The original recording was a single session by DJ AM, with assistance from John Mathews and a folk-inspired arrangement under the guidance of Lillian Klein. The track blends contemporary Christian lyrical themes with a melodic, symphonic style. It is known for its distinct chord progression, emotional vocal delivery, and the inclusion of a rap consisting of the thematic verses. The song achieved modest chart success, peaking at #25 on the Christian Music UK charts in March 2003. The release was followed by an official music video, which premiered on the DJ AM Vortex channel_mies.se on 10 November 2017.

It is produced by phosphorylation of acetyl\u2011CoA by acetyl\u2011CoA carboxylase (ACC), the committed regulatory step of lipogenesis.  In the fatty acid synthase complex, malonyl\u2011CoA binds to the acyl\u2011phosphopantetheine arm of the malonyl\u2011transferase domain, where it undergoes decarboxylation to generate a highly reactive malonyl\u2011Carbene (or acetyl\u2011\u2013C_3\u202f\u2013) that is transferred to the ketosynthase active site.  The ketosynthase then catalyzes a Claisen\u2011type condensation between the acetyl\u2011CoA primer (or a growing acyl\u2011chain) and the malonyl\u2011derived unit, extending the fatty acid chain by two carbons.

Key influences include: 1)\u202fVedic and post\u2011Vedic rituals, where dance and movement were integral to worship and storytelling; 2)\u202fTemple art and iconography, especially from the Pallava, Chola, Vijayanagara, and Mughal periods, which provided visual and narrative templates for choreography; 3)\u202fCourtly patronage across regional kingdoms (e.g., the Mysore court for Bharatanatyam, the courts of Odisha for Odissi, the Mysore and Tanjore regions for Kathakali), which codified styles, costumes, and technical conventions; 4)\u202fThe classical literary texts such as the\u202fNatyashastra (circa 200\u202fBCE\u2013200\u202fCE) and subsequent commentaries, which offered systematic frameworks for rhythm, gestures, and dramaturgy; and 5)\u202fSyncretic exchanges between Hindu, Muslim, and Buddhist cultures, particularly evident in ragini movements of Kathak, the use of Persian musical instruments, and the blending of Sanskrit and local languages. These converging streams over centuries produced the distinct yet interrelated repertoire of India\u2019s eight officially recognized classical dance traditions: Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Manipuri, Mohiniyattam, Odissi, and Sattriya.",

A verb is classified as strong if its stem vowel changes (ablaut) during the conjugation process. The exact number of strong verbs is not fixed because new words and verb forms can enter the language over time, but we can give approximate figures based on authoritative sources.</p>\n\n**Approximate counts (based on recent dictionaries and academic studies)**\n\n| Source | Date | Approx.

For plain text or programming, the most common representation is the asterisk character (*), which many languages use as the multiplication operator. If you need a typographically correct multiplication sign (\u00d7), you can insert it in Unicode straightforwardly: type `\u00d7` (U+00D7) directly if your keyboard supports it, or use an input method such as Ctrl\u202f+\u202fShift\u202f+\u202fU followed by `00D7` in environments that allow Unicode entry (e.g., Linux terminal). In HTML, you can write `&times;` or `&#215;`. So:\n\n- Programming / plain text: `*`\n- Unicode multiplication sign: `\u00d7` (U+00D7)\n- HTML entity: `&times;` or `&#215;`",

      "question": "why was the plague that struck athens so devastating",
      "original_extracted": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>The plague that struck Athens in 430\u2011429\u202fBCE was devastating because it combined several factors that amplified its lethality and crippled the city\u2011state in ways that ordinary diseases seldom could: \n\n1. **The pathogen itself \u2013 smallpox (or a related poxvirus)**  \n   - Historical accounts describe fever, skin eruptions, and high mortality, all characteristic of smallpox or a pox\u2011like illness. Smallpox spreads efficiently by droplets and via contaminated fomites, and its incubation period (7\u201317\u202fdays) allowed asymptomatic spreaders to travel across the city.  \n   - The disease had a high case\u2011fatality rate (up to 30\u202f% in unvaccinated populations), so even a moderate number of cases translated into many deaths.\n\n2. **Massive population density and unsanitary conditions**  \n   - Athens was a dense urban center with overcrowded housing, poor drainage, and shared water sources, providing ideal conditions for the spread of airborne and contact\u2011transmitted diseases.  \n   - The river Phlyetes (near the Helladic wall) and the varying levels of water contamination created a continual cycle of re\u2011infection.\n\n3. **Timing during the Peloponnesian War**  \n   - The plague struck while Athens was besieged by the Spartans and allied forces. The war forced Athenian soldiers and civilians into cramped camps and ships, accelerating transmission.  \n   - The once\u2011robust Athenian navy suffered loss of crews; the plague hampered the APS\u2019s ability to maintain garrisons or reinforce its army.\n\n4. **Economic and political repercussions**  \n   - The death of the wealthy merchant class and the slump in trade severely diminished city revenue.  \n   - A collapsing economy undermined the Athenian ability to pay for infrastructure, religious festivals, and to support the democratic state apparatus, which was particularly dependent on citizen participation.\n\n5. **Psychological shock and religious turmoil**  \n   - The plague eroded confidence in Athenian religion and civic institutions. Religious temples were closed, and damnatio memoriae (the erasure of the dead) was enacted to treat the deceased as a source of contagion, discouraging the mourning process that offered social cohesion.  \n   - Philosophers such as Socrates resigned to the disease, reflecting the growing sense of futility and cognitive dissonance among the populace.\n\n6. **Demographic imbalance**  \n   - With roughly 250,000 people in Athens, even a 10\u201315\u202f% mortality rate would have killed 25,000\u201338,000 individuals. The loss was disproportionately concentrated among the working class and soldiers\u2014those vital for dungeon labor and military defense.  \n\n7. **Compounding social patterns**  \n   - Plague mortality was not randomly distributed: widows, servants of wealthy families, and the elderly suffered more. The social fabric of Athens was altered, and centuries later, plagues like the Black Death in the 14th century similarly took advantage of flattened class lines.\n\nIn summary, the Athenian plague was devastating because it was a highly lethal disease, spread efficiently in a crowded urban environment, and occurred during a major war that overloaded and disrupted the city\u2019s social, political, and economic systems. The combination of biological, environmental, and human factors turned a natural epidemic into a catastrophic blow to the very heart of classical Athens.",

By the early 2000s, the word appeared in dictionaries (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary) and was widely used in business, finance, and academia to describe long\u2011term ecological, economic, and social viability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, while ideas related to sustainability existed in the early 20th century, the term \u201csustainability\u201d began to be used as a formal concept in the 1970s, saw its major boost with the 1987 Brundtland Report, and entered widespread global usage by the late 1990s.</p>",

Its trade partners can be grouped into major regions and key economies. Below is an overview of the principal trading partners and the main goods exchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Major Trade Partners by Region\n\n| Region | Key Partners | Typical Exports from DRC | Typical Imports to DRC |\n|--------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Africa** | **South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia** | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, tin, coltan, gold, timber, raw agricultural products | Machinery & vehicles, refined petroleum, processed food, electronics, pharmaceuticals |\n| **Europe** | **Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain** | Copper, cobalt, other metals, minerals, lumber, agricultural products | Chemicals, machinery, petroleum products, processed foods, textiles |\n| **Asia** | **China, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam** | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, minerals | Stainless steel, steel products, industrial machinery, vehicle parts, textiles, chemicals, electronics |\n| **United States** | **United States** | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, minerals, some lumber | Pharmaceuticals, plastics, equipment, refined petroleum, agricultural machinery |\n| **Rest of the World** | **Canada, Brazil, Turkey, Israel, South Africa** | Varied metals and minerals | Industrial equipment, consumer goods, chemicals, machinery |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Export Highlights\n\n- **Copper** \u2013 The DRC is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of copper, accounting for >40\u202f% of global export value.\n- **Cobalt** \u2013 Roughly 70\u202f% of world supply comes from the DRC, making it a critical supply chain for batteries.\n- **Diamonds & Gold** \u2013 Structured through mining companies and sometimes through artisanal operations (e.g., \u201cconflict-free\u201d labeling is increasingly important).\n- **Other Minerals** \u2013 Tin, coltan, tungsten, and phosphates also have significant export flows.\n- **Agricultural Products** \u2013 cocoa, coffee, cotton (in smaller volumes), and forest products (timber, rubber, solvents).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Import Highlights\n\n- **Industrial Machinery & Equipment** \u2013 Particularly from China and Germany (oven blocks, presses, mining rigs).\n- **Petroleum Products** \u2013 Mostly refined petroleum; DRC imports more gasoline and diesel than it exports.\n- **Processed Foods** \u2013 Sugar, cooking oil, and packaged foods from Europe and Japan.\n- **Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals** \u2013 Basic chemicals (acids, alkalis) and prescription drugs.\n- **Consumer Goods** \u2013 Electronics, mobiles, textiles, clothing from Asia and the US.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Key Dynamics\n\n1. **China\u2019s Dominance** \u2013 China is the largest recipient of copper, cobalt, and other minerals, and also a major supplier of machinery and finished goods.\n\n2. **South Africa\u2019s Dual Role** \u2013 Imports more from the DRC in terms of machinery and refined products, while sending back industrial equipment and chemicals.\n\n3. **European Technical Goods** \u2013 Germany and Belgium bring advanced mining equipment, machinery, and refined chemicals, while the DRC exports raw minerals in return.\n\n4. **Frequent Trade Facilitation** \u2013 The DRC\u2019s \u201chub\u201d role in commodity sales to East Africa and the Andean region is supported by ports on the Atlantic and the Canal.\n\n5. **Impact of Political Dynamics** \u2013 Sectoral tariffs, sanctions, and the \u201cConflict-Free\u201d diamond certification affect trade flows, especially for precious minerals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Emerging Trade Opportunities\n\n- **Renewable Energy** \u2013 Importing turbines, solar panels & batteries (e.g., from Germany, Japan) aligns with the DRC\u2019s power\u2011generation needs.\n- **Infrastructure** \u2013 Large construction contracts (roads, rail, ports) from foreign firms provide local services and infrastructure exports.\n- **Agricultural Processing** \u2013 Export of processed foods (cocoa, coffee) to the EU is an area for diversification.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s trade network is heavily weighted toward commodity exports\u2014especially copper and cobalt\u2014primarily to China and other Asian countries, while importing machinery, refined petroleum, and consumer goods mainly from Europe, China, and the United States. Trade dynamics are shaped by global commodity prices, rising demand for battery metals, and the country\u2019s efforts to develop a more diversified economy.",

Import Highlights\n\n- **Industrial Machinery & Equipment** \u2013 Particularly from China and Germany (oven blocks, presses, mining rigs).\n- **Petroleum Products** \u2013 Mostly refined petroleum; DRC imports more gasoline and diesel than it exports.\n- **Processed Foods** \u2013 Sugar, cooking oil, and packaged foods from Europe and Japan.\n- **Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals** \u2013 Basic chemicals (acids, alkalis) and prescription drugs.\n- **Consumer Goods** \u2013 Electronics, mobiles, textiles, clothing from Asia and the US.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Trade Partners \u2013 2023 Top 10 by Value\n\n| Rank | Partner | Exports (USD M) | Imports (USD M) | Net Trade (USD M) |\n|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | China | 6,415 | 3,289 | **+3,126** |\n| 2 | South Africa | 3,735 | 5,610 | **\u20111,875** |\n| 3 | Germany | 2,120 | 2,900 | **\u2011780** |\n| 4 | Belgium | 1,790 | 2,530 | **\u2011740** |\n| 5 | France | 1,480 | 2,300 | **\u2011820** |\n| 6 | Brazil | 1,140 | 830 | **+310** |\n| 7 | India | 910 | 640 | **+270** |\n| 8 | United Arab Emirates | 870 | 780 | **+90** |\n| 9 | Netherlands | 780 | 1,040 | **\u2011260** |\n| 10 | Canada | 690 | 610 | **+80** |\n\n*(Numbers approximate; derived from UN Comtrade data 2023.)*\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Dynamics\n\n1. **China\u2019s Dominance** \u2013 China is the largest recipient of copper, cobalt, and other minerals, and also a major supplier of machinery and finished goods.\n\n2. **South Africa\u2019s Dual Role** \u2013 Imports more from the DRC in terms of machinery and refined products, while sending back industrial equipment and chemicals.\n\n3. **European Technical Goods** \u2013 Germany and Belgium bring advanced mining equipment, machinery, and refined chemicals, while the DRC exports raw minerals in return.\n\n4. **Frequent Trade Facilitation** \u2013 The DRC\u2019s \u201chub\u201d role in commodity sales to East Africa and the Andean region is supported by ports on the Atlantic and the Canal.\n\n5. **Impact of Political Dynamics** \u2013 Sectoral tariffs, sanctions, and the \u201cConflict-Free\u201d diamond certification affect trade flows, especially for precious minerals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Emerging Trade Opportunities\n\n- **Renewable Energy** \u2013 Importing turbines, solar panels & batteries (e.g., from Germany, Japan) aligns with the DRC\u2019s power\u2011generation needs.\n- **Infrastructure** \u2013 Large construction contracts (roads, rail, ports) from foreign firms provide local services and infrastructure exports.\n- **Agricultural Processing** \u2013 Export of processed foods (cocoa, coffee) to the EU is an area for diversification.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s trade network is heavily weighted toward commodity exports\u2014especially copper and cobalt\u2014primarily to China and other Asian countries, while importing machinery, refined petroleum, and consumer goods mainly from Europe, China, and the United States. Trade dynamics are shaped by global commodity prices, rising demand for battery metals, and the country\u2019s efforts to develop a more diversified economy.",

The liturgical prayer is usually said as follows:\n\n1. **Start** at the sign of the cross, while addressing the Divine Mercy sacral beads, closing with a name of Jesus (e.g., \u201cJesus, I love you\u201d).\n\n2. **Handle** the chaplet beads in the standard way:\n\n   - One prayer (the Glory Hail) on the **first bead** (the \u2018four\u2019 bead).  \n   - Six prayers for the **prayerful composition**: pray \u201cO Parent of Grace\u201d (or \u201cO Divine Mercy\u201d in the prayer) on each of the six universal prayers slipped between the beads.  \n   - The \u201cHail, Praises, Glory be to the Father\u201d on the last bead of the chaplet, accompanied by a friendly prayer of the chaplet.\n\n3. **Conclude** with the \u201cGlory, Hail, Mercy\u201d (the standard recitation).  \n\nEssentially, you can pray the chaplet during any part of the prayer cycle, and it\u2019s best done on Tuesday and Friday or on any day that feels appropriate to you. The Chaplet of Divine Mercy is also sometimes recited on Sundays or during Masses, as an addition to the Normal chapter for the prayers that accompany the chaplet. Possibly also in a devotional atmosphere (e.g., at a Good Friday procession), as part of a Gospel or Scripture reading.\n\nIn short: The common times to pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy are on Tuesdays, Fridays, any day you want a daily devotional, or during a liturgical special occasion\u2014where any 15-20\u2011minute slot with the humour of the bar or cross is sufficient.",

If the gestational sac and yolk sac remain but no fetal pole grows, or if the size of the sac does not increase appropriately, the ultrasound may then be considered a possible early pregnancy loss. It\u2019s also important to confirm that the pregnancy is truly intrauterine (not ectopic) and that the dating of the pregnancy is correct. Therefore, at this stage most clinicians advise a follow\u2011up scan in a week to confirm growth and viability.

The British gained a very large portion of the African continent after the Bafra-Voges War in 1818, then also the island of Madagascar. Most significantly, the British Empire in its prime (late 19th\u2013early 20th\u202fcenturies) had colonies and territories covering an area of approximately 8 million square kilometres, eclipsing the whole of Asia and Africa combined, thus essentially controlling a continent\u2011wide domain. Therefore, the only true continent fully dominated by the British colonial empire was Africa (and to a lesser degree, Asia when Britain momentarily held a number of strategic possessions). The question is answered by noting that the British Empire had, after the loss of the French Empire, virtually complete dominion over Africa and, to a comparable extent, over Asia in the early 1800s.

With the combined support of the Spanish government, the municipality of Barcelona and a large number of private donors, the building is now proceeding at an almost annual rate.\n\nOn 25\u202fJune\u202f2022, the project\u2019s architects announced a projected completion date of 2028, which would coincide with the 100\u202fth anniversary of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s death. The revised schedule is based on the current construction speed, the schedule of the remaining fa\u00e7ades and the ongoing finishing work on the interior and roof structure.\n\nTherefore, following the latest information available as of 2026, the most widely circulated estimate is that the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia should be finished in 2028.

      "original_extracted": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>Presbyopia is a natural age\u2011related loss of near\u2011focus ability that occurs gradually from the early 40s onward. Because it involves the progressive stiffening of the crystalline lens and weakening of the ciliary muscle, it cannot be \u201ccured\u201d in the sense of reversing the underlying changes. However, there are several effective ways to eliminate or greatly reduce its visual\u2011defect symptoms:\n\n| Approach | How it works | Typical outcome | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|--------------|-----------------|------|------|\n| **Multifocal eyeglass lenses** (monovision, bifocals, progressive) | Adds an additional power region for near work. | You can read or do close\u2011up tasks without other correction. | Simple, inexpensive, no surgery. | May cause halos, glare, or difficulty with depth perception in low\u2011light. |\n| **Contact lenses** \u2013 monovision or multifocal (including toric for astigmatism) | Same principle as glasses, but contacts may provide a nearer field with little distortion. | Clear vision at all distances, less visual fatigue. | Better for sports/activities, no visible glasses. | Requires daily hygiene; may not be suitable for dry eyes or severe presbyopia. |\n| **Low\u2011dose monovision** | One eye is corrected for distance, the other for near. | Often improves overall visual satisfaction with minimal lifestyle change. | Minimal adaptation period, retains good depth perception. | Requires the brain to combine two images; some people cannot tolerate disparity. |\n| **Refractive surgery** \u2013 LASIK, PRK, or Conductive Keratoplasty (CK) | Reshapes the cornea to improve near focus or reduces corneal curvature for hyperopia. | You may obtain a limited degree of near vision, often combined with glasses for fine work. | Permanent change, fast recovery. | Limited effect for advanced presbyopia; risk of dry eye or regression. |\n| **Intra\u2011ocular lenses (IOLs)** \u2013 multifocal or accommodating | Replaces or augments the natural lens during cataract or refractive surgery. | Near, intermediate and distance vision can be achieved. | High success rate, especially for cataract patients. | Costly; some patients report halos, glare, or reduced contrast. |\n| **Keratoprosthesis or lens replacement** \u2013 special procedures (e.g., implantable contact lenses like the Baerveldt or the Reflotron) | Replaces eye structures to provide clear visual pathways. | Clears vision across the range. | Useful for complex or severe cases. | Invasive, high cost, significant recovery time. |\n| **Vision\u2011training exercises** (orthoptic or vision therapy) | Strengthens accommodation and vergence control. | Can delay the need for correction in mild cases. | Non\u2011invasive, low\u2011cost. | Limited evidence for long\u2011term benefit; requires commitment. |\n\n### Choosing the Right Option\nThe best solution depends on:\n\n1. **Severity of presbyopia** (how many diopters of near vision are required).  \n2. **Lifestyle needs** (sports vs. desk work, reading habits).  \n3. **Eye health** (corneal thickness, presence of cataracts).  \n4. **Financial resources** (some surgical options are expensive).  \n5. **Preference for glasses vs. contacts**.\n\n### Practical Steps\n1. **Consult an optometrist or ophthalmologist** to review your clear\u2011distance prescription and assess lens\u2011flexibility.  \n2. **Experiment with trial frames** or low\u2011dose monovision settings.  \n3. **If considering surgery, get a second opinion** from a board\u2011certified ophthalmologist.  \n4. **Discuss all risks, benefits, and costs** for each treatment.  \n5. **Plan a follow\u2011up schedule** to monitor visual outcomes and adjust prescriptions as necessary.\n\n**Bottom line:** Presbyopia cannot be \u201cfixed\u201d by reversing biology, but it can be effectively managed with glasses, contacts, or surgical options that let you see clearly at all distances.",

The brothers remain incarcerated, with Lyle growing older; both are currently serving lengthy terms (by 2026 Lyle is in his 70s and Erik in his 60s).

He was born around 1731 in St. Mary's County, Maryland, and became a Black British army officer and lawyer. In 1765, Cooper moved to the Colony of Virginia, where he served in the militia and later joined the Sons of Liberty. He was politically active in Virginia and was a foot soldier in the American Revolution. Cooper was one of the earliest Black public leaders in Britain, who was appreciated for his political activities and advocated for Black voting rights when the first laws were framed for Black people to register to vote for the first time. He played a significant role in the development of civil rights for Black people in the United States and British Empire, and was a key predecessor to the wider Black voter registration movement. However, depending on the specific regional and legal context, some references might highlight other individuals, such as Leonard Jenynson (so\u2011called \u201cearly vote\u2011seeking\u201d in Virginia around 1799) or others in the early United States, but William Cooper is commonly cited as the earliest prominent Black voter registration in the U.S. during the 18th century.",

It is occupational or locational: it was originally given to a person who lived near a stream, river, or marsh, or who worked in such an area (e.g., a water\u2011keeper or someone who dealt with water supplies).  In some cases it comes from the Middle English word \u201cwate\u201d (water) or the Old Norse \u201cvatn\u201d (water).  The name spread throughout England, Scotland and Ireland and was found among English, Scottish and Irish families.

      "question": "why is the indian ocean the warmest in the world",
      "original_extracted": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>The Indian Ocean is often cited as one of the warmest major oceans in the world, and this is primarily a result of a combination of geographical, climatic, and oceanographic factors. Below is a detailed explanation of why the Indian Ocean tends to be warmer than other oceans.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Geographic Position\n\n### 1.1 Latitude\n- The Indian Ocean sits mostly between **0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0\u202fS** latitude.\n- This mid\u2011to\u2011low latitude position places it directly in the path of the **Sun\u2019s strongest radiation**, leading to higher surface temperatures.\n\n### 1.2 Narrower Below\u2011Equatorial Shelf\n- The Indian Ocean has a larger proportion of deep water just below the equatorial region, but it is also relatively *shallow* in much of the western hemisphere (e.g., the Arabian Sea), which allows solar heating to penetrate more easily.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reduced Ocean Currents\n\n- **Weak Surface Currents**: Compared with, say, the North Atlantic's Gulf Stream, the Indian Ocean has fewer strong surface currents that would normally transport cooler waters from higher latitudes toward the equator.\n- **Pristine Warmwater Accumulation**: The reduced current mixing allows warm surface waters to remain suspended.\n\n### 2.1 Subtropical Gyre Containment\n- The Indian Ocean is bounded by relatively stable **subtropical gyres**, which help retain warm surface waters.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Atmospheric Conditions\n\n### 3.1 Low Wind Friction\n- Seasonal winds (e.g., the monsoon) do not create the same level of turbulence as the westerlies in higher latitudes, resulting in weaker vertical mixing and a stable warm surface layer.\n\n### 3.2 Persistent High Pressure Systems\n- The **South Asian High** and **West African High** deliver clear, dry conditions that foster fewer cloud cover and increased solar insolation over large parts of the Indian Ocean.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Oceanic Features and Heat Distribution\n\n### 4.1 Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)\n- The IOD is a natural variation that alternates the western part of the Indian Ocean being warmer or cooler relative to the eastern part. During its *positive phase*, the western Indian Ocean can reach significantly higher temperatures (up to **+2\u202f\u00b0C** relative to neutral conditions).\n\n### 4.2 Deep Water Formation\n- Relative to other oceans, the Indian Ocean has **fewer large-scale convective upwelling events** that bring cooler water to the surface, especially during boreal summer.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Global Temperature Trends\n\n- The Indian Ocean exhibits the **largest upward trend** in surface temperature over the past 40 years, largely due to **anthropogenic global warming** and the region\u2019s sensitivity to climate change.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Comparative Data Snapshot\n\n| Ocean | Avg. Surface Temp (\u00b0C) | Primary Latitude Band | Notable Current(s) | Rate of Heat Increase (\u00b0C/decade) |\n|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Indian | **~28\u201329** | 0\u201330\u202fS | Weak monsoon currents | **+0.18** |\n| Pacific | 23\u201324 | 0\u201330\u202fN/S | Kuroshio, Leeuwin | +0.15 |\n| Atlantic | 20\u201321 | 0\u201330\u202fN | Gulf Stream | +0.10 |\n| Southern | 12\u201313 | 30\u202fS \u2013 60\u202fS | Antarctic Circumpolar | +0.12 |\n\n*(Values are approximate and based on satellite & buoy datasets up to 2024.)*\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bottom Line\n\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s **central tropical location**, **relatively calm surface currents**, **clear skies during key seasons**, and **unique oceanic dynamics** (such as the IOD) combine to maintain a consistently higher surface temperature than 90\u202f% of the world's oceans. The ongoing trend of global warming further amplifies this effect, ensuring that the Indian Ocean remains one of the warmest marine environments on Earth.\n\n---",
