Key examples include:\n\n1. **Alcohols** \u2013 e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, where the hydrogen atom attached to oxygen (\u2013OH group) bonds with lone pairs on another oxygen or electronegative atom.  \n2. **Amines and amides** \u2013 e.g., ammonia (NH\u2083), primary/secondary/tertiary amines, amides such as acetamide or peptide bonds, where hydrogen on nitrogen interacts with heteroatoms.  \n3. **Carboxylic acids** \u2013 e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, where the \u2013OH hydrogen can hydrogen\u2011bond to carbonyl oxygen or other \u2013OH groups, leading to dimerization.  \n4. **Ketones, aldehydes, and esters** \u2013 e.g., acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl acetate; the hydrogen on an adjacent carbon or hydrogen on the heteroatom can act as a donor/acceptor.  \n5. **Sugars and nucleic\u2011acid bases** \u2013 e.g., glucose, DNA bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, uracil); hydroxyl groups on sugars and the N\u2013H or C\u2013H groups on the bases form extensive networks of hydrogen bonds.  \n6. **Proteins and peptides** \u2013 backbone C=O and N\u2013H groups form the hydrogen\u2011bonded \u03b1\u2011helix, \u03b2\u2011sheet, and turns.  \n7. **Other small molecules** \u2013 e.g., hydrogen chloride (HCl) D\u2013bond (weak), HF, NH\u2083, and many heterocycles such as pyridine, imidazole, and triazole.  \n8. **Ions with hydrogen bonds** \u2013 e.g., ammonium ion (NH\u2084\u207a) and hydronium ion (H\u2083O\u207a).  \n\nIn general, any molecule containing a heteroatom (O, N, F, Cl) with a hydrogen attached to it can potentially serve as a hydrogen\u2011bond donor, while heteroatom lone pairs can act as acceptors.

It is used to treat major depressive disorder, chronic pain, and certain anxiety conditions. It works mainly by increasing the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. The core chemical structure consists of three connected aromatic rings (hence \"tricyclic\"). The classification also shows other drugs like nortriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine. Somatic side\u2011effects commonly include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention, weight gain and hypnotic action. In older patients with atrial fibrillation, potent anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for electrolyte disturbances, delirium, or arrhythmia. Although p\u2011butane recommendations advise that patients with certain heart conditions avoid tricyclics, derivatives such as amitriptyline are still widely prescribed in the first\u2011line treatment of depression. In psychopharmacological classification, amitriptyline belongs to sub\u2011class 4 (TCA). Its prescription amount is typically 25\u2011150\u00a0mg/day, taken once at bedtime, with dosage adjustments as needed. A typical dosing schedule may be 25\u201150\u00a0mg in the evening, increased by 25\u00a0mg increments every 3\u20114 days until symptoms control or side effects limit further increases. Pharmacokinetically, the drug has a half\u2011life of 10\u201124\u00a0h, and it is metabolized by CYP2C19, 2D6, 2C9, 3A4. The drug\u2013drug interaction risk is high because many drugs inhibit CYP2D6 or other key enzymes. Counseling patients to avoid alcohol, CNS depressants, and NSAIDs is essential.

Its rulings are binding on all lower courts, government agencies, and citizens.\n   - **Appellate Jurisdiction**: It hears and decides appeals from the lower courts (Regional Trial Courts, Court of Appeals) on both civil and criminal matters, as well as certain special courts and tribunals.\n   - **Original Jurisdiction in Certain Cases**: The Court has original jurisdiction in cases involving disputes among states, disputes between the national government and the regional governments, cases involving the election of the President and Vice President, and in cases involving the impeachment of high officials.\n   - **Mixed and Writ Jurisdictions**: It can issue writs such as habeas corpus, certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus to enforce legal rights, correct abuses, and prevent unlawful acts.\n   - **Special Powers of the Court in Charitable Organizations**: Under Section 21 of the Rules of Court, it can oversee and supervise the operations of charities and other beneficiary institutions, including the appointment and removal of trustees.\n\n2. **Administrative Functions**\n   - **Supreme Court Administration**: The Court manages its own administrative needs, sets procedural rules, and oversees the day\u2011to\u2011day functioning of the judiciary.\n   - **Supervision of Lower Courts**: It reviews the performance and conduct of lower courts and judges, and may set guidelines, training, and, if necessary, impose disciplinary action.\n   - **Appointment and Training**: While the national lawyer's bar exam and the judiciary\u2019s appointments are guided by other bodies, the Supreme Court provides continuing legal education and seminars to improve the quality of jurisprudence.\n\n3. **Disciplinary Authority**\n   - **Magisterial Disciplinary Action**: The Court holds the power to discipline judges and other judicial officers for corruption, mental unfitness, incompetence, or conduct that undermines public confidence in the judiciary.\n   - **Sanctions**: Disciplinary orders can include admonishment, suspension, removal, and full or partial disbarment of lawyers.\n\n4. **Interpretation and Clarification of the Law**\n   - **Presiding over the Council of State**: It issues the jurisprudential or legal doctrines that guide how laws are implemented and interpreted.\n   - **Consistency in Judgments**: By case law lists, it establishes binding legal principles to ensure consistency across the courtroom system.\n\n5. **Coordination with Executive and Legislative Branches**\n   - **Rule\u2011making Functions**: The Court adopts Rules of Court that govern processes and substantive legal standards for all courts under its jurisdiction.\n   - **Advisory Role**: While it is strictly an adjudicatory body, the Court may consult the legislature or the executive in matters of national importance or pending constitutional amendments.\n\n6. **Special Powers in Examination of the Constitution**\n   - **Constitutional Emergencies**: In special circumstances, the Court can issue orders that facilitate quick legislative action or temporarily fill the void in constitutional governance, while ensuring no infringement of fundamental rights.\n\n7. **Remedies and Relief**\n   - **Prenote**: The Court may grant the writs of certiorari, review, prohibition, mandamus, habeas corpus, or the writ of quo warranto, as appropriate.\n   - **Special Courtings**: It can convene special courts or panels for certain cases (e.g., anti\u2011graft and corruption cases).\n\n**Limitations and Contours**\n\n- The Court\u2019s decisions are final, but it periodically submits opinions on constitutional reforms or inter\u2011branch disputes to the National Conference on Constitutional Law.\n- Its enforcement power is limited to issuing judgments and recommendations; it does not have direct executive enforcement powers beyond the bureaucratic enforcement mechanisms adhered to by the government.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Philippines wields **judicial authority (ultimate appellate, original jurisdiction in selected matters, writ jurisdiction)**, **administrative control over the judiciary**, **disciplinary power over judges and lawyers**, **interpretive power that shapes legal doctrine**, and **coordination with the executive and legislative branches**.

The expression combines the generic name \u201cJack\u201d (often used in English to mean \u201cany man\u201d or \u201ca type of fellow\u201d) with \u201cMormon,\u201d and the resulting phrase was used, especially by non\u2011LDS people, to describe a Mormon who was perceived to be lax in his religious observance, especially regarding issues such as alcohol, tobacco, or moral conduct.\n\nThe term appears to have entered popular usage in the United States around the mid\u20111800s, a time when the LDS Church was still relatively new and where the practice of polygamy was stirring controversy. It was used in newspapers, pamphlets, and verse to disparage Mormonism or to suggest that it was not as devout as other Christian denominations.

      "extracted_prediction": "The phrase \u201cJack Mormon\u201d is a nineteenth\u2011century American English slang term that originally referred to a Mormon who was regarded as being unusually indifferent or indifferent to the strict moral standards of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\u2011Day Saints (LDS Church). The expression combines the generic name \u201cJack\u201d (often used in English to mean \u201cany man\u201d or \u201ca type of fellow\u201d) with \u201cMormon,\u201d and the resulting phrase was used, especially by non\u2011LDS people, to describe a Mormon who was perceived to be lax in his religious observance, especially regarding issues such as alcohol, tobacco, or moral conduct.\n\nThe term appears to have entered popular usage in the United States around the mid\u20111800s, a time when the LDS Church was still relatively new and where the practice of polygamy was stirring controversy. It was used in newspapers, pamphlets, and verse to disparage Mormonism or to suggest that it was not as devout as other Christian denominations. By the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the connotation had shifted somewhat; \u201cJack Mormon\u201d could also be used more playfully or proudly by Mormons themselves to refer to a fellow who was more laid\u2011back or \u2018Americanized\u2019 in his habits.

Here is an overview of key events and trends occurring around that time:\n\n**1. Global Politics and Imperialism**\n\n- **European Imperialism:** European powers (Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium) were engaged in a scramble for colonies, largely in Africa and Asia. Boundaries were redrawn during the Berlin Conference (1884\u201185), solidifying spheres of influence, though 1900 was already a period when many African territories were still being administered indirectly or outrightly.\n  - *France* controlled large parts of West and Central Africa (e.g., French West Africa) and the colony of French Somaliland.\n  - *Britain* maintained the British Raj in India, controlled the Egypt and Sudan (officially British Protectorate from 1884), and dominated the African coast through Rhodesia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.\n  - *Germany* had recently annexed German East Africa (Tanzania) and German Southwest Africa (Namibia).\n  - *Spain* remained in the Philippines until the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898 but was losing its overseas dominions.\n\n- **United States:** Emerging as a world power following the victory in the Spanish\u2013American War, the U.S. had annexed Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, treating them as part of \u201cthe protectorate of American imperialism.\u201d The country was also experiencing domestic industry expansion and urbanization.\n\n- **Oct 1900**: The Boxer Rebellion in China had ended earlier in 1900 (June), after the Eight-Nation Alliance (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the US) intervened, resulting in a humiliating military occupation and the imposition of punitive reparations on the Qing dynasty.\n\n- **Japan\u2019s Meiji Restoration (1868\u20131912)**: Japan underwent rapid modernization and industrialization, becoming a major regional power. By 1900, Japan had defeated Russia at the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201105) and had begun building a navy capable of challenging Western powers.\n\n**2. Economic Landscape**\n\n- **Industrial Revolution:** Europe and the US were in the heart of the Second Industrial Revolution, characterized by steel, expanded railway networks, electrical wiring, and mechanical production. This unevenly extended to the rest of the world: Germany\u2019s industrialization was robust; Australia and Canada were growing as resource exporters.\n\n- **Agricultural and Labor Movements:** Workers in industrial centers were organizing strikes for better wages and working conditions, while the global economy remained heavily agrarian in many regions, especially in Latin America and Africa.\n\n**3. Scientific and Technological Advances**\n\n- **Physics and Theories of Matter:** In 1900, Max Planck proposed the concept of energy quanta (1900), laying the groundwork for quantum theory. Albert Einstein would refine his ideas later (1905), and on this same year Martinus N. van Leeuwenhoek re\u2011discovered some of his early studies on microbiology.\n\n- **Photography and Cinema:** The Lumi\u00e8re brothers had introduced the first public cinema screenings in 1895. In 1900, cinematographers were experimenting with short films that would later evolve into narrative feature films.\n\n- **Electrical and Chemical Engineering:** The incandescent light bulb had already illuminated cities but still faced production improvements. Viscous lithium batteries were first introduced.\n\n**4. Social Dynamics**\n\n- **Gender and Labor:** Women began to join industrial factories in larger numbers. The suffrage movement was active across Britain, the United States, and other nations. However, limited rights remained for women in most places.\n\n- **Immigration:** Large flows of migrants moved to the US and Canada seeking economic opportunities. The \u201cWhite Australia\u201d policy had just been implemented (1901 for permanent immigration), reflecting racial attitudes.\n\n- **Healthcare:** The germ theory of disease had become accepted, improving public hygiene, but epidemics (e.g., bubonic plague, typhoid) still posed threats.\n\n**5. Major Cultural Moments**\n\n- **Art Movements:** Europe saw the emergence of Art Nouveau, Symbolism, and Expressionism. In Russia, the stray \u201cThe Tretyakov Collection\u201d and M. C. Escher's heritage and social introspecting footnotes, represented by authors like Atom Dmitrieff.\n\n- **Literary Figures:** 1900 saw the publication of literary classics such as Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and in Britain, Arthur Conan Doyle's ongoing detective series of Sherlock Holmes.\n\n- **Music:** The period also witnessed the birth of many composers, including Austrian *Gustav Mahler* who began his second symphony around 1901.\n\n**6. World Events in 1900**\n\n| Region | Key Events |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Europe** | Germany\u2019s National Board of Railroads organizes the largest conference. The Dreyfus Affair continues in France. |\n| **Middle East** | The Ottoman Empire faces internal pressures and a series of concessions to European powers, such as the British pledge to protect the Suez Canal. |\n| **India** | The 1900\u20131902 \u201cPartition of Bengal\u201d diffusion led to progressive reforms, albeit the movement largely remains unsettled. |\n| **Africa** | European colonization continues with Britain at the Cape, France in the Congo, and Belgium in the Congo Free State. |\n| **South America** | Brazil's first major industrial factories open. Argentina\u2019s industrial growth continues. |\n\n**7. In Summary**\n\nThe year 1900 represented a juncture of old colonial structures meeting new technological prospects. While Western industrial powers had set the pace, many other regions were still either in the throes of imperial domination or formulating independent futures, leading the continent's stay in the new century. The period boldly set the stage for unprecedented global interconnectivity, war, and transformation.",

The main developments were:\n\n1. **Emergence of Germanic Kingdoms**  \n   - **Ostrogoths** under Theodoric the Great occupied Italy (493\u2013553).  \n   - **Visigoths** ruled Hispania and southern Gaul (415\u2013711).  \n   - **Franks** established a powerful kingdom in Gaul, which later evolved into the Frankish Empire under Clovis and his successors, laying the groundwork for modern France and Germany.  \n   - **Vandals** briefly controlled North Africa (435\u2013534), but their kingdom collapsed under the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) reconquest.  \n   - Other groups, such as the Burgundians and Lombards, established smaller kingdoms that later merged or were absorbed into larger entities.\n\n2. **Byzantine Reconquests and Influence**  \n   - Emperor Justinian I (527\u2013565) temporarily re\u2011captured parts of Italy (including Ravenna) and the provinces of North Africa (534\u2013533). These reconquests were short\u2011lived, but Byzantine administrative and legal practices left a lasting imprint, especially in eastern Italy.\n\n3. **Continuation of Roman Institutions**  \n   - Legal text such as the **Corpus Juris Civilis** compiled by Justinian was widely used by the new Germanic rulers.  \n   - Roman administrative and land\u2011holding systems were adapted to the new kingdoms, allowing a degree of continuity, especially among the rural population and in cities like Rome, Constantinople, and Ravenna.\n\n4. **Cultural and Religious Continuity and Change**  \n   - Christianity, already established, became the dominant religion. The rise of the **Papacy** in Rome (formally recognized in 754) brought new political authority that would later clash with the Frankish and Italian princes.  \n   - Latin literacy persisted in monasteries, schools, and ecclesiastical institutions, preserving much of Roman culture and influencing the development of medieval Latin scholarship.\n\n5. **Economic and Social Adjustments**  \n   - Trade shifted from the large, centrally organized Roman markets to more localized, feudal arrangements.  \n   - The economy became increasingly agrarian and fortified, as centralized Roman infrastructure fell into disrepair.  \n   - A new class of land-owning nobles emerged, establishing the feudal system that characterized the Middle Ages.\n\n6. **Legacy and Foundation for Europe**  \n   - The political boundaries drawn by the Germanic kingdoms divided the former empire into regions that would become the basis for future nation-states.  \n   - Roman law, urban culture, engineering, and administrative practices survived through the Middle Ages, adapted by the successor states.  \n\nIn sum, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its lands were re\u2011organized into a patchwork of Germanic kingdoms, a continuing Byzantine\u2011controlled eastern rim, and enduring Roman cultural, legal, and administrative traditions that shaped the early medieval period and the emergence of modern Europe.",

It is produced by phosphorylation of acetyl\u2011CoA by acetyl\u2011CoA carboxylase (ACC), the committed regulatory step of lipogenesis.  In the fatty acid synthase complex, malonyl\u2011CoA binds to the acyl\u2011phosphopantetheine arm of the malonyl\u2011transferase domain, where it undergoes decarboxylation to generate a highly reactive malonyl\u2011Carbene (or acetyl\u2011\u2013C_3\u202f\u2013) that is transferred to the ketosynthase active site.  The ketosynthase then catalyzes a Claisen\u2011type condensation between the acetyl\u2011CoA primer (or a growing acyl\u2011chain) and the malonyl\u2011derived unit, extending the fatty acid chain by two carbons.

Smallpox spreads efficiently by droplets and via contaminated fomites, and its incubation period (7\u201317\u202fdays) allowed asymptomatic spreaders to travel across the city.  \n   - The disease had a high case\u2011fatality rate (up to 30\u202f% in unvaccinated populations), so even a moderate number of cases translated into many deaths.\n\n2. **Massive population density and unsanitary conditions**  \n   - Athens was a dense urban center with overcrowded housing, poor drainage, and shared water sources, providing ideal conditions for the spread of airborne and contact\u2011transmitted diseases.  \n   - The river Phlyetes (near the Helladic wall) and the varying levels of water contamination created a continual cycle of re\u2011infection.\n\n3. **Timing during the Peloponnesian War**  \n   - The plague struck while Athens was besieged by the Spartans and allied forces. The war forced Athenian soldiers and civilians into cramped camps and ships, accelerating transmission.  \n   - The once\u2011robust Athenian navy suffered loss of crews; the plague hampered the APS\u2019s ability to maintain garrisons or reinforce its army.\n\n4. **Economic and political repercussions**  \n   - The death of the wealthy merchant class and the slump in trade severely diminished city revenue.  \n   - A collapsing economy undermined the Athenian ability to pay for infrastructure, religious festivals, and to support the democratic state apparatus, which was particularly dependent on citizen participation.\n\n5. **Psychological shock and religious turmoil**  \n   - The plague eroded confidence in Athenian religion and civic institutions. Religious temples were closed, and damnatio memoriae (the erasure of the dead) was enacted to treat the deceased as a source of contagion, discouraging the mourning process that offered social cohesion.  \n   - Philosophers such as Socrates resigned to the disease, reflecting the growing sense of futility and cognitive dissonance among the populace.\n\n6. **Demographic imbalance**  \n   - With roughly 250,000 people in Athens, even a 10\u201315\u202f% mortality rate would have killed 25,000\u201338,000 individuals. The loss was disproportionately concentrated among the working class and soldiers\u2014those vital for dungeon labor and military defense.  \n\n7. **Compounding social patterns**  \n   - Plague mortality was not randomly distributed: widows, servants of wealthy families, and the elderly suffered more. The social fabric of Athens was altered, and centuries later, plagues like the Black Death in the 14th century similarly took advantage of flattened class lines.\n\nIn summary, the Athenian plague was devastating because it was a highly lethal disease, spread efficiently in a crowded urban environment, and occurred during a major war that overloaded and disrupted the city\u2019s social, political, and economic systems. The combination of biological, environmental, and human factors turned a natural epidemic into a catastrophic blow to the very heart of classical Athens.",

Theoretically designed to let the Rangers form a *\u201csuper\u2011Zord\u201d* by merging the kinetic energies of the four. | Red Rangers (Trickster Supreme Team) | Since the film\u2019s plot is mostly a relaunch, the Zord is not fully finished when the Beast King confronts the Rangers, but it's showcased in the music video and trailer content. |\n| 6 | **Predator Monster** | The main antagonist, \"Predator,\" cast in a creature \u201cNIGHT-MONSTER / BEAST KING\u201d that has 4 main vehicle-like exoskeletons (Single / double). | **None** \u2013 Enemy Zord, but still relevant to the plot. | The Predator has a \u201ccolosseum\u2011style\u201d arena where the Rangers must fight in several massive battles. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Though the Zord is not fully activated in the movie, it plays an important role when the Rangers attempt to gather cry\u2011shards at high velocity.\n\n- **Special**: When combined, the combined energy creates a **5\u2011megawatt** beam capable of **shocking** the Earth\u2019s terrain.

Its trade partners can be grouped into major regions and key economies. Below is an overview of the principal trading partners and the main goods exchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Major Trade Partners by Region\n\n| Region | Key Partners | Typical Exports from DRC | Typical Imports to DRC |\n|--------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Africa** | **South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia** | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, tin, coltan, gold, timber, raw agricultural products | Machinery & vehicles, refined petroleum, processed food, electronics, pharmaceuticals |\n| **Europe** | **Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain** | Copper, cobalt, other metals, minerals, lumber, agricultural products | Chemicals, machinery, petroleum products, processed foods, textiles |\n| **Asia** | **China, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam** | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, minerals | Stainless steel, steel products, industrial machinery, vehicle parts, textiles, chemicals, electronics |\n| **United States** | **United States** | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, minerals, some lumber | Pharmaceuticals, plastics, equipment, refined petroleum, agricultural machinery |\n| **Rest of the World** | **Canada, Brazil, Turkey, Israel, South Africa** | Varied metals and minerals | Industrial equipment, consumer goods, chemicals, machinery |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Export Highlights\n\n- **Copper** \u2013 The DRC is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of copper, accounting for >40\u202f% of global export value.\n- **Cobalt** \u2013 Roughly 70\u202f% of world supply comes from the DRC, making it a critical supply chain for batteries.\n- **Diamonds & Gold** \u2013 Structured through mining companies and sometimes through artisanal operations (e.g., \u201cconflict-free\u201d labeling is increasingly important).\n- **Other Minerals** \u2013 Tin, coltan, tungsten, and phosphates also have significant export flows.\n- **Agricultural Products** \u2013 cocoa, coffee, cotton (in smaller volumes), and forest products (timber, rubber, solvents).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Import Highlights\n\n- **Industrial Machinery & Equipment** \u2013 Particularly from China and Germany (oven blocks, presses, mining rigs).\n- **Petroleum Products** \u2013 Mostly refined petroleum; DRC imports more gasoline and diesel than it exports.\n- **Processed Foods** \u2013 Sugar, cooking oil, and packaged foods from Europe and Japan.\n- **Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals** \u2013 Basic chemicals (acids, alkalis) and prescription drugs.\n- **Consumer Goods** \u2013 Electronics, mobiles, textiles, clothing from Asia and the US.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Trade Partners \u2013 2023 Top 10 by Value\n\n| Rank | Partner | Exports (USD M) | Imports (USD M) | Net Trade (USD M) |\n|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | China | 6,415 | 3,289 | **+3,126** |\n| 2 | South Africa | 3,735 | 5,610 | **\u20111,875** |\n| 3 | Germany | 2,120 | 2,900 | **\u2011780** |\n| 4 | Belgium | 1,790 | 2,530 | **\u2011740** |\n| 5 | France | 1,480 | 2,300 | **\u2011820** |\n| 6 | Brazil | 1,140 | 830 | **+310** |\n| 7 | India | 910 | 640 | **+270** |\n| 8 | United Arab Emirates | 870 | 780 | **+90** |\n| 9 | Netherlands | 780 | 1,040 | **\u2011260** |\n| 10 | Canada | 690 | 610 | **+80** |\n\n*(Numbers approximate; derived from UN Comtrade data 2023.)*\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Dynamics\n\n1. **China\u2019s Dominance** \u2013 China is the largest recipient of copper, cobalt, and other minerals, and also a major supplier of machinery and finished goods.\n\n2. **South Africa\u2019s Dual Role** \u2013 Imports more from the DRC in terms of machinery and refined products, while sending back industrial equipment and chemicals.\n\n3. **European Technical Goods** \u2013 Germany and Belgium bring advanced mining equipment, machinery, and refined chemicals, while the DRC exports raw minerals in return.\n\n4. **Frequent Trade Facilitation** \u2013 The DRC\u2019s \u201chub\u201d role in commodity sales to East Africa and the Andean region is supported by ports on the Atlantic and the Canal.\n\n5. **Impact of Political Dynamics** \u2013 Sectoral tariffs, sanctions, and the \u201cConflict-Free\u201d diamond certification affect trade flows, especially for precious minerals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Emerging Trade Opportunities\n\n- **Renewable Energy** \u2013 Importing turbines, solar panels & batteries (e.g., from Germany, Japan) aligns with the DRC\u2019s power\u2011generation needs.\n- **Infrastructure** \u2013 Large construction contracts (roads, rail, ports) from foreign firms provide local services and infrastructure exports.\n- **Agricultural Processing** \u2013 Export of processed foods (cocoa, coffee) to the EU is an area for diversification.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s trade network is heavily weighted toward commodity exports\u2014especially copper and cobalt\u2014primarily to China and other Asian countries, while importing machinery, refined petroleum, and consumer goods mainly from Europe, China, and the United States. Trade dynamics are shaped by global commodity prices, rising demand for battery metals, and the country\u2019s efforts to develop a more diversified economy.",

Trade Partners \u2013 2023 Top 10 by Value\n\n| Rank | Partner | Exports (USD M) | Imports (USD M) | Net Trade (USD M) |\n|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | China | 6,415 | 3,289 | **+3,126** |\n| 2 | South Africa | 3,735 | 5,610 | **\u20111,875** |\n| 3 | Germany | 2,120 | 2,900 | **\u2011780** |\n| 4 | Belgium | 1,790 | 2,530 | **\u2011740** |\n| 5 | France | 1,480 | 2,300 | **\u2011820** |\n| 6 | Brazil | 1,140 | 830 | **+310** |\n| 7 | India | 910 | 640 | **+270** |\n| 8 | United Arab Emirates | 870 | 780 | **+90** |\n| 9 | Netherlands | 780 | 1,040 | **\u2011260** |\n| 10 | Canada | 690 | 610 | **+80** |\n\n*(Numbers approximate; derived from UN Comtrade data 2023.)*\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Dynamics\n\n1. **China\u2019s Dominance** \u2013 China is the largest recipient of copper, cobalt, and other minerals, and also a major supplier of machinery and finished goods.\n\n2. **South Africa\u2019s Dual Role** \u2013 Imports more from the DRC in terms of machinery and refined products, while sending back industrial equipment and chemicals.\n\n3. **European Technical Goods** \u2013 Germany and Belgium bring advanced mining equipment, machinery, and refined chemicals, while the DRC exports raw minerals in return.\n\n4. **Frequent Trade Facilitation** \u2013 The DRC\u2019s \u201chub\u201d role in commodity sales to East Africa and the Andean region is supported by ports on the Atlantic and the Canal.\n\n5. **Impact of Political Dynamics** \u2013 Sectoral tariffs, sanctions, and the \u201cConflict-Free\u201d diamond certification affect trade flows, especially for precious minerals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Emerging Trade Opportunities\n\n- **Renewable Energy** \u2013 Importing turbines, solar panels & batteries (e.g., from Germany, Japan) aligns with the DRC\u2019s power\u2011generation needs.\n- **Infrastructure** \u2013 Large construction contracts (roads, rail, ports) from foreign firms provide local services and infrastructure exports.\n- **Agricultural Processing** \u2013 Export of processed foods (cocoa, coffee) to the EU is an area for diversification.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s trade network is heavily weighted toward commodity exports\u2014especially copper and cobalt\u2014primarily to China and other Asian countries, while importing machinery, refined petroleum, and consumer goods mainly from Europe, China, and the United States. Trade dynamics are shaped by global commodity prices, rising demand for battery metals, and the country\u2019s efforts to develop a more diversified economy.",

      "raw_prediction": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>Rigor mortis, the post\u2011mortem stiffening of muscles, plays a crucial role in meat processing for several reasons:\n\n1. **Timing of Processing Steps**  \n   - **Marbling and Tenderizing**: Rigor mortis begins within 1\u20136\u202fhours after slaughter and peaks around 8\u201312\u202fhours.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for web pages, for example, centralizes fonts, colors, spacing, and layout decisions so that designers and developers can create correct, responsive designs without building from scratch each time. This leads to faster prototyping, easier maintenance, and a more predictable user experience.\n\nCombined, a strong style guide and well\u2011maintained style sheets create a unified brand identity, improve collaboration across disciplines, and ultimately elevate the quality of products and communications.",

      "raw_prediction": "<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>The Indian Ocean is often cited as one of the warmest major oceans in the world, and this is primarily a result of a combination of geographical, climatic, and oceanographic factors. Below is a detailed explanation of why the Indian Ocean tends to be warmer than other oceans.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Geographic Position\n\n### 1.1 Latitude\n- The Indian Ocean sits mostly between **0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0\u202fS** latitude.\n- This mid\u2011to\u2011low latitude position places it directly in the path of the **Sun\u2019s strongest radiation**, leading to higher surface temperatures.\n\n### 1.2 Narrower Below\u2011Equatorial Shelf\n- The Indian Ocean has a larger proportion of deep water just below the equatorial region, but it is also relatively *shallow* in much of the western hemisphere (e.g., the Arabian Sea), which allows solar heating to penetrate more easily.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reduced Ocean Currents\n\n- **Weak Surface Currents**: Compared with, say, the North Atlantic's Gulf Stream, the Indian Ocean has fewer strong surface currents that would normally transport cooler waters from higher latitudes toward the equator.\n- **Pristine Warmwater Accumulation**: The reduced current mixing allows warm surface waters to remain suspended.\n\n### 2.1 Subtropical Gyre Containment\n- The Indian Ocean is bounded by relatively stable **subtropical gyres**, which help retain warm surface waters.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Atmospheric Conditions\n\n### 3.1 Low Wind Friction\n- Seasonal winds (e.g., the monsoon) do not create the same level of turbulence as the westerlies in higher latitudes, resulting in weaker vertical mixing and a stable warm surface layer.\n\n### 3.2 Persistent High Pressure Systems\n- The **South Asian High** and **West African High** deliver clear, dry conditions that foster fewer cloud cover and increased solar insolation over large parts of the Indian Ocean.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Oceanic Features and Heat Distribution\n\n### 4.1 Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)\n- The IOD is a natural variation that alternates the western part of the Indian Ocean being warmer or cooler relative to the eastern part. During its *positive phase*, the western Indian Ocean can reach significantly higher temperatures (up to **+2\u202f\u00b0C** relative to neutral conditions).\n\n### 4.2 Deep Water Formation\n- Relative to other oceans, the Indian Ocean has **fewer large-scale convective upwelling events** that bring cooler water to the surface, especially during boreal summer.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Global Temperature Trends\n\n- The Indian Ocean exhibits the **largest upward trend** in surface temperature over the past 40 years, largely due to **anthropogenic global warming** and the region\u2019s sensitivity to climate change.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Comparative Data Snapshot\n\n| Ocean | Avg. Surface Temp (\u00b0C) | Primary Latitude Band | Notable Current(s) | Rate of Heat Increase (\u00b0C/decade) |\n|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Indian | **~28\u201329** | 0\u201330\u202fS | Weak monsoon currents | **+0.18** |\n| Pacific | 23\u201324 | 0\u201330\u202fN/S | Kuroshio, Leeuwin | +0.15 |\n| Atlantic | 20\u201321 | 0\u201330\u202fN | Gulf Stream | +0.10 |\n| Southern | 12\u201313 | 30\u202fS \u2013 60\u202fS | Antarctic Circumpolar | +0.12 |\n\n*(Values are approximate and based on satellite & buoy datasets up to 2024.)*\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bottom Line\n\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s **central tropical location**, **relatively calm surface currents**, **clear skies during key seasons**, and **unique oceanic dynamics** (such as the IOD) combine to maintain a consistently higher surface temperature than 90\u202f% of the world's oceans. The ongoing trend of global warming further amplifies this effect, ensuring that the Indian Ocean remains one of the warmest marine environments on Earth.\n\n---",
