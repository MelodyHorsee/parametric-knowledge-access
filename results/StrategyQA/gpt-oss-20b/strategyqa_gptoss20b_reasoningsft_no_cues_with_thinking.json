Actually deepest point is the \"Arctic Ocean's depth: 4,650 m at the Arctic Ocean's \"Gulf of the Arctic\"?

In the film, there's a black fly? The main character is Seth Brundle, who becomes a fly. There's a black fly? The film features a black fly that appears in the lab? There's a scene where a black fly appears, but the main insect is the human-fly hybrid. Was the black fly upstaged by another insect? Possibly the \"black fly\" is the human-fly hybrid, but upstaged by the \"fly\" (the human). Actually the black fly is the main character. Upstaged by another insect? The film has a scene where a black fly (Seth) is upstaged by a large black fly? But maybe the answer is False: No, Black fly was not upstaged. I think the question refers to the black fly being upstaged by the human-fly hybrid? Actually the film's title is \"The Fly\". The black fly? In the film, there is a black fly that is upstaged by a bigger insect? I think the answer is False.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>False</answer>",
