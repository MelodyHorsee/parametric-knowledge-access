Actually Kerry attended Yale for undergrad and then Georgetown Law. So alma mater likely Yale. Did any Golden Globe winners attend Yale? Many actors studied at Yale. Eg. Meryl Streep? She didn't. But many: Bradley Cooper? No. Actually Golden Globe winners like Alec Baldwin? He didn't. But many actors are Yale alumni: e.g., James Franco? He is not. Wait: James Earl Jones? He attended? He didn't. But there are many: e.g., Paul Rudd? No. But we can find at least one: e.g., actor Jon Hamm? No. But I know that actor and Golden Globe winner \"James Franco\" didn't. But actor \"Jennifer Lawrence\" didn't. But actor \"Robert Downey Jr.\" didn't. But actor \"Julia Roberts\" didn't. But actor \"Tom Hanks\" didn't. But actor \"Brad Pitt\" didn't. But actor \"Matt Damon\" didn't. Hmm.\n\nBut there are many Golden Globe winners who attended Yale: e.g., actor \"Laurence Fishburne\" not. Wait.\n\nLet's think: Many actors studied at Yale School of Drama: e.g., \"Kevin Spacey\" (Golden Globe winner) studied at Yale School of Drama. Yes, Kevin Spacey won Golden Globes. He attended Yale School of Drama. So answer is True.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|><answer>True</answer>",

He had 45? Not sure. The question: \"Have any murderers outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record?\" Murderers? Maybe referring to WWE wrestlers with last names \"Murderer\"? Or \"Murderers\" as a group? Could be referencing the \"Murderers\" tag team? But likely referring to \"Kane's Royal Rumble record\" meaning the wrestler Kane's record for longest time spent in the Royal Rumble match? Actually Kane had a record of 41 minutes? Let's recall: Kane had a record of 41:24? He was in 2010? Wait, Kane was a 2010 Royal Rumble? Actually Kane is a WWE wrestler; he was in the 2009 Royal Rumble? He lasted 39 minutes? But the record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match is held by Kane with 41:24? Let's check: The record for longest time spent in a Royal Rumble match is held by Kane (41:24 in 2009). Has any murderer outlasted that? Murderers could refer to \"The Undertaker\" (a murderer? No). Maybe \"The Murderer\" is a wrestler? There is a wrestler named \"Murderer\"? There is a wrestler \"The Murderer\" in NWA? Not sure.\n\nPossibly the question is a trick: \"murderers\" refers to \"The Undertaker\" because he's a \"deadman\" murderer? Eh.\n\nMaybe it's about the \"Royal Rumble\" record for longest time in the match: Kane (41:24) 2010. Has anyone else lasted longer? I think the record was broken by Roman Reigns? Actually Roman Reigns lasted 44:30? Wait I recall Roman Reigns had 44:30 in 2015? Not sure. But I think the record was broken by Roman Reigns in 2015? Actually Roman Reigns had 44:30 in 2015? Let's check memory: In 2015 Royal Rumble, Roman Reigns lasted 44:30? He lasted 44:30? That would surpass Kane's 41:24. So answer would be True: Yes, some murderers outlasted Kane's record. But \"murderers\" might refer to \"The Undertaker\" (he's a \"murderer\"?). However, the question: \"Have any murderers outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record?\" Might be referencing \"The Undertaker\" as a murderer? But Undertaker is a wrestler, not murderer. The phrase \"murderer\" might refer to \"The Undertaker\" as a \"murderer\"? Not.\n\nAlternatively, \"murderers\" could refer to \"The Undertaker's tag team 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's 'The Undertaker's \"?? This is confusing.\n\nMaybe it's a pun: \"murderers\" refers to \"The Undertaker\" because he 'murdered' his opponents? But no.\n\nMaybe the question is from a trivia: \"Have any murderers outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record?\" The answer: No, because Kane's record remains unbeaten. I think Kane's record is still the longest time in a Royal Rumble match: 41:24 by Kane. No one else has outlasted that.

Likely 1800s refers to 19th century (1801-1900). Presidents in that period: 1: Washington?

Wait maybe he married 5 times: Elizabeth Taylor (twice), Jill St. John, Maria Schell, and Elizabeth Taylor again? That's 4. I'm confused.
